#### **Lead Management**


The Lead Management application enables your sales agents and sales development
representatives to create leads and nurture them into opportunities.


In a sales cycle, prospective customers express their interest through various channels, such
as website forms, social media, or events. With the information captured through these
channels, the sales agent creates a lead. After a lead is created, it goes through multiple
processes to get converted into an opportunity.


The processes include:


**•** Lead scoring: Prioritizing leads based on predefined criteria for more focused attention.


**•** Lead qualification: Determining if a lead meets certain criteria to be considered a sales
qualified lead.


**•** Lead assignment: Assigning leads to the correct sales development representative to

follow up.

**•** Lead nurturing: Engaging with leads until they become sales-ready.


**•** Lead segmentation: Categorizing leads based on industry, behavior, or other parameters

for targeted marketing.


As sales agents move through the lead workflow and recognize interest from customers in
buying products, it becomes essential to qualify or convert the lead. This process includes
linking the lead to specific accounts and establishing lead qualification, which ultimately
generates product orders.

manual activities that can be set up to engage with leads and customers at every stage of
their relationship with your business through various channels.


**Customer Engagement Sequences overview**


Use ServiceNow [® ] Customer Engagement Sequences to provide structured plans to sales
representatives for prospects, which helps ensure consistent messaging and effective
objection-handling. Standardizing repetitive tasks means representatives can focus on highvalue actions.

**Customer Engagement Sequences users**


**Users**






|User|Description|
|---|---|
|Sequence admin,<br>sequence writer<br>(For example,<br>Sales admin, Sales<br>Development<br>Manager (SDR))|Creates multi-step sequences using Workflow Studio and defines<br>triggers (start conditions), activities (for example, call attempts), and<br>exit conditions.|
|Sequence task<br>owner<br>(For example, Sales<br>representative,<br>customer success<br>manager, telesales<br>representative)|Views sequence tasks that are assigned to them and executes<br>targeted outreach strategies, often using a combination of<br>emails, phone calls, and social media, to engage prospects and<br>move them through the initial stages of the sales funnel using the<br>predefined sequence steps.|



**Customer Engagement Sequences workflow**


The following illustration describes the tasks involved in configuring and using Customer
Engagement Sequences.


**Creating and using Customer Engagement Sequences**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-9-3.png)


**1.** As a sequence admin, create a customer engagement sequence such as a lead-nurturing

sequence from the CSM Configurable Workspace.


**2.** Define the sequence parameters:


**◦** Trigger conditions (for example, when a new lead is created)


**◦** Sequence steps (for example, call, follow-up, email)


**◦** Step frequency (for example, wait three days between steps)


**◦** Exit conditions (for example, lead conversion or disqualification)


**3.** Test and activate the sequence.

Other company names, product names, and logos may be trademarks of the respective companies with which they are associated.


**4.** Every record that meets the trigger condition is added to the sequence, and a sequence

task associated with the record is created. For example, when a new lead record is
created in the system, the sequence is run, and it generates a sequence task.


**5.** As a sequence task owner, view the assigned sequence task and complete the series of

predefined activities that are part of it. For example:


**◦** Day 1: Call the prospect


**◦** Day 4: Make a follow-up call and use a questionnaire to gather more information


**6.** The sequence task moves to closed state when all sequence steps have been completed

or the predefined exit condition is met.

#### **Opportunity Management**

The ServiceNow [® ] Opportunity Management application enables your sales agents and
account executives to analyze customer needs and generate product recommendations for
potential customers.


An opportunity in Sales and Order Management provides maximum information about a
product or service based on the needs of a customer (called a qualified lead). A lead for a
product is the minimal information that a sales agent uses to advance the conversation with
a potential customer and create an opportunity.


**Opportunity workflow in Sales and Order Management**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-11-0.png)


**Opportunity Management interface**


The Opportunity Management application is integrated with the Product Catalog and
product configurator to help sales agents access product offerings to build opportunities
easily and conveniently. The Opportunity Management interface contains the following tabs:


**Opportunity Management tabs**

|Tab Description|Col2|
|---|---|
|Details tab|Add basic information for the opportunity.|

**Opportunity Management tabs (continued)**

|Tab Description|Col2|
|---|---|
|Quotes tab|Create quotes directly from opportunities.|



**Integrating pricing in Opportunity Management**


Opportunity Management integrates with the pricing engine to consume the default price list
and displays the total price and unit price of product offerings in your opportunity.


Based on the prices of product offerings (POs) that are added to the opportunity, the total
price values are auto-calculated. For more information, see Add and view the details of an
opportunity and Add line items to an opportunity.


Pricing in Opportunity Management provides the following benefits:


**•** Revenue forecasting: The pricing engine helps agents evaluate an opportunity's total worth

by computing the combined prices of each offering included, which in turn helps teams to
strategize resource or budget allocation for deals.


**•** Deal prioritization: By analyzing the potential revenue of each opportunity, your sales team

can focus on the deals based on their financial impact. For example, teams can focus on
deals with higher potential revenue and higher margins.


**•** Negotiation enhancement: The pricing engine gives your sales team real-time pricing

insights, which enhances the negotiation process by enabling your sales team to tailor
offers that meet customer needs while maintaining profitability.


To learn more about pricing, see Pricing Management.


**What to do next**


To learn about setting up Opportunity Management, see Install and configure Opportunity
Management.

#### **Sales Forecasting**


Project your future sales and revenue based on data from opportunities, historical
performance, and pipeline analysis using Sales Forecasting. With this application, sales
managers can allocate resources effectively, receive constructive feedback, and forecast
sales with precision to make informed decisions.


Sales representatives are directly involved in communicating with their managers about the
sales opportunities that they are handling, offering insights into what they expect to close
during the forecast period. Sales Forecasting uses the data from the opinions and insights
of your sales representatives on how they feel about the deals in their pipeline. The longer
a prospect progresses along the sales pipeline, the better their chances of converting. For
example, a prospect who just signed up for your product’s free trial is 20% more likely to
convert into a paying customer. Whereas a prospect who attended the product demo is
80% likely to sign a contract.


Sales managers own the overall forecast for a group of sales representatives. Sales managers
collect data from their team members and adjusting the forecasts based on these insights.
They set sales targets and quotas for individual representatives and distribute targets .

**Key benefits**


**•** Resource allocation: Efficiently allocate budget and resources based on projected sales

and revenue expectations.


**•** Budgeting and Financial Planning: Supports financial planning and budget creation by

offering insights into anticipated revenue.


**•** Sales Target Setting: Define sales targets and quotas for sales teams, territories, and

individual sales representatives.


**•** Tracking Sales Targets: Track the sales and status of quota target achieved for your agents

and team.


**Sales Forecasting terminology**


Use the following list of terms to gain an understanding of Sales Forecasting concepts,
components, and configuration.


**Forecast Model**


The forecast Model is a framework or method used to predict future sales based on historical
data, current sales activities, and other relevant factors. It helps businesses estimate the
expected sales figures over a specific period, such as a quarter or year. Only one forecast
model, Opportunity Amount Forecast is available to the users. You can view forecast the
sales for the current opportunities in the system.


**Forecast Category**


The classification of opportunities is based on the level of certainty regarding their closure.
The longer a sales prospect progresses along the sales pipeline, the better their chances
of converting. The forecast admin can configure these categories. By default, these six
categories are available:


**•** Won: Opportunities that have already been closed and won.


**•** Commit: Opportunities that sales reps are confident will close within the forecast period.


**•** Strong upside: Opportunities with greatest potential to close but have some minor

uncertainty.


**•** Upside: Opportunities with potential to close but with lower level of certainty.


**•** Pipeline: Opportunities in the early stages of the sales process with uncertainty if they will be

closed deals.


**•** Omitted: Opportunities that are excluded from forecast due to lack of data.


**Forecast rollup method**


The forecast model defines how opportunities within different categories are aggregated
into a forecast. There are two primary types of rollups: single and cumulative.


When you select Single, this rollup method ensures that each forecast category is
represented in its own column, with only the opportunities in that category being included.


**Single rollup method**

|Column Name on Forecast page|Opportunities that roll up to it from a forecast<br>category|
|---|---|
|Pipeline|Pipeline|

**Single rollup method (continued)**

|Column Name on Forecast page|Opportunities that roll up to it from a forecast<br>category|
|---|---|
|Upside|Upside|
|Strong Upside|Strong Upside|
|Commit|Commit|
|Won|Won|



When you select Cumulative, this rollup method aggregates forecast categories in a
cumulative manner, where each subsequent category includes the opportunities from the
previous categories. Each cumulative rollup method aggregates opportunities from higher
order forecast categories.


**Cumulative rollup method**

|Column Name on Forecast page|Opportunities that roll up to it from a forecast<br>category|
|---|---|
|Open pipeline|Pipeline + Upside + Strong Upside + Commit<br>+ Won|
|Cumulative Upside|Upside + Strong Upside + Commit + Won|
|Cumulative Strong Upside|Strong Upside + Commit + Won|
|Cumulative Commit|Commit + Won|
|Won|Won|



**Forecast schedule**


The forecast schedule fetches all the opportunities in the system and generates the latest
forecast data.


**Sales Quota Management**


You can assign sales quota targets to sales representatives and managers based on their
hierarchy, role, and forecast period.

#### **Product Catalog Management**


Product Catalog Management enables your organization to manage your product offerings
by grouping them into catalogs and categories, which streamlines the ordering process and
helps manage leads, opportunities, quotes, and orders in Sales and Order Management.


Product Catalog Management provides various features to implement product catalogs
and categories in your organization.


**•** Product catalog user interface: Launch from anywhere in lead, opportunity, quote, and

order capture workflows, enabling agents to browse and find products quickly with a full
catalog search function.


**•** Catalog category hierarchy: Use hierarchical structures of catalogs and categories to

organize products and services logically.

**•** Version control: Track changes made to product information over time, helping with

transparency and auditability.


**•** Product offer eligibility: Filter your product catalogs, product offering categories, and

product offerings so that agents sell customers only the products for which they’re eligible.
To learn more about setting up product eligibility, see Configuring product offer eligibility.


**Note:** Check your entitlements to determine if you have access to these features. Also,

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-16-0.png)


**Product offer bundling**


You can create product offer bundles with an offer hierarchy using product offer
relationships and relationship groups. These bundle offers can have references to a product
specification or specification hierarchy at any level in the bundle. For more information, see
Product offer bundling with product specifications.


**Product offer eligibility**


As a product catalog admin or manager, you can use business rules to filter the product
catalog, product offering categories, and product offerings dynamically, displaying only the
appropriate catalog, categories, and offerings for which a customer is eligible. These rules
enable your sales agents to sell the correct products to customers based on context, such
as specific customer accounts, customer location, sales contracts, and more. You define
these rules using product eligibility matrices. To learn more about using the product eligibility
matrices, see Configuring product offer eligibility.


**Product recommendations**


In Sales and Order Management, different types of product recommendations are available
to your sales agents. Your agents can get product recommendations as they're generating
or updating leads and opportunities, or updating quotes.


**•** Product recommendations using needs analysis - When your sales agents are generating

leads and opportunities, they can use product selection guides to help determine relevant
products for their customers. For information on setting up needs analysis, including
the product selection guides, see Configuring needs analysis. For details on how your
agents can get product recommendations for leads and opportunities, see Get product
recommendations for leads using needs analysis and Get product recommendations for
opportunities using needs analysis.


**•** Product offering recommendations for quotes - When your sales agents are updating

quotes, they can get product recommendations for upselling or cross-selling
additional products for existing quote line items. For information on setting up these
recommendations, see Configuring product offering recommendations. For details on
how product offering recommendations work in quotes, see Using product offering
recommendations in quotes.

#### **Pricing Management**

The Pricing Management application enables your organization to set, manage, and
optimize pricing strategies for any Sales and Order Management solution. These pricing
strategies enable your sales team to generate opportunities, quotes, and orders with
accurate and competitive pricing quickly.


The Pricing Management application is the foundation of any Sales and Order Management
solution. Pricing Management provides various features to implement pricing in your
organization.


**Note:** Check your entitlements to determine if you have access to these features.


**Price lists**


Price lists define the prices for products and services offered by your organization. Your
agents use price lists to find product pricing quickly when creating quotes and capturing
orders. Your pricing admins or managers create price lists and add price list lines that define
the list price for each of your product offerings. They can also copy a published price list and
its price list lines and use the copy to update the pricing or reuse the price list without having
to create a new price list.


Support for multiple price lists


Pricing Management supports multiple price lists, such as price lists based on
currency or customer account. The initial, default price list that you create is
based on the currency used, but you can change the default price list used
by your agents. For example, you can create account-based price lists that
are tailored to the needs and preferences of a specific customer or provide
pre-negotiated prices for them. You can set an account-based price list as the
default, which is then used by your agents when they create quotes or orders for
that particular customer.


**Example of account-based price list**

Pricing methods


The pricing method is either a one-time fee or a recurring pricing fee with
monthly and annual frequencies. The pricing method is set in product offerings
and is displayed in price list lines.


For details on setting up and managing price list features, see Configuring product pricing.


**Sales Agreement price lists**


If you're using the Sales Agreement feature, a published sales agreement price list is
generated automatically when a sales agent creates a sales agreement from a completed
quote. The sales agreement price list reflects the final unit price for each product that is
captured as part of the sales agreement. The sales agreement price list is valid for the start
and end dates specified for the agreement. To learn more about sales agreements, see
Sales Agreement Management.


**Example of sales agreement price list**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-18-0.png)


**Cost books**


Cost books define the unit cost for product offerings. This information is used in the Quote
Management application to provide sales agents with the unit cost, unit margin amount,
and unit margin percentage for products in quotes. With this information, your sales agents
can perform a simple profitability analysis by subtracting the cost of the product offer from
the quoted selling price.

**Example cost book in quote details and margins in quote line**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-19-0.png)


Your pricing admins or managers create a cost book and add a cost book line to set the
unit cost for each product offering. They can also copy a published cost book and its cost
book lines to revise costs in the cost book (update the copy) or reuse a cost book without
having to create a new one. For details on setting up cost books and cost book lines, see
Create and publish a cost book and Create a cost book line. For information on activating
the cost book and cost margin features in Quote Management, see Configuring Quote
Management.


**Cost-based attribute adjustments**


As a pricing admin, you can capture the base cost for a product based on its characteristics,
such as model or size, since those attributes can affect the final cost. You can define a
cost-based attribute adjustment for a product by specifying a fixed amount or percentage
markup or markdown to be applied to all cost books or to selected cost book lines. The base
costs are used by the pricing engine to calculate profit margins for products in sales quotes.
For more information, see Create and publish a cost-based attribute adjustment.


**Price adjustments**


In Pricing Management, you can adjust the list price of your products by specifying a
markdown or markup fixed amount or percentage, or a price override, based on the
following features:


**• Product attributes** : Define a price adjustment based on product characteristics, such as

model or color. For more information, see Create and publish a product attribute-based
pricing adjustment.


**• Non-product attributes** : Create a price adjustment based on characteristics that aren’t

related to a product, such as shipping information or sales channel. For example, you can
create a pricing adjustment for customers in a particular region. For details, see Create a
non-product attribute pricing adjustment.


**• Bundled products** : Create price adjustments for product offerings in a bundled product.

For example, you might want to specify a markdown amount for certain product offerings
in the bundle, because the bundle provides discounted pricing. For more information, see
Create pricing adjustments for bundled products.

**Pricing matrices**


Pricing matrices are frameworks for setting conditions in decision rules, which enable you
to implement complex pricing adjustments and manage default price list or cost book
selection. For instance, if you have multiple price lists, you can use a pricing matrix to specify
the conditions that determine the default price list to be applied when agents create a
quote or order. Pricing Management offers the following matrices:


**• Price List Defaulting** : Select the default price list to be used, such as the standard price list

or an account-specific price list. For more information on configuring this price list matrix,
see Control the default price list on transaction header or header line.


**• Cost Book Defaulting** : Select the default cost book to be used, for example the standard

cost book or an account-specific cost book. To learn more about configuring this matrix,
see Control the default cost book on transaction header or header line.


**• Standard Price Adjustment** : Apply an adjustment based on context variables that represent

non-product attributes, such as shipping location or account. Pricing Management
provides certain system-defined, non-product context variables that you can use in
this matrix, but you can also create your own custom variables, for example, market
segment. Your pricing administrator can work with your administrator to develop custom
context variables that can be used in pricing matrixes. For details on configuring these
adjustments, see Create a non-product attribute pricing adjustment. For more information
on configuring custom context variables, see Create a custom context variable and Map
a custom context variable to a transaction entity.


**• Configuration Component Price Adjustment** : Adjust the price of a product when it's sold as

part of a product bundle. For details, see Create pricing adjustments for bundled products.


**Matrix validations**


As an admin, you can use system-defined validations or set your own validations to validate
rows entered into the decision tables for pricing and product eligibility rule matrices. For more
information on these validations, see Configuring matrix validation rules.


**Pricing plans**


Starting with the November 2024 release, Pricing Management provides a default pricing
plan that defines the sequence of steps in which pricing calculations and adjustments are
applied to determine final product prices. Adjustments include the pricing changes set in the
pricing adjustment matrices. You can use the default plan, or you can copy the default plan
and customize it by adding or changing the pricing steps to tailor it for your organization. To
learn more, see Configurable pricing plans.


**Pricing extensions**


Pricing extensions are integration points that your administrator can use to customize the
pricing engine, giving you the flexibility to use pricing information from external sources or
control the pricing engine processing logic. Pricing Management provides these extensions:


**•** Select Price List (DefaultPriceListExtensionPoint): Change the selection logic for using the

default price list on a quote or order header.


**•** Select Cost Book (DefaultCostBookExtensionPoint): Change the selection logic for using the

default cost book on a quote header.


**•** Get Product List Price (ListPriceExtensionPoint): Get pricing directly from another data

source or extend the current price list derivation.

**•** Apply Attribute Adjustments (AttributeAdjustmentExtensionPoint): Get attribute adjustments

from another data source, such as product manufacturers, or extend the current
adjustment derivation logic.


**•** Get Cost (CostExtensionPoint): Get the unit cost for a product offering directly from another

data source or extend the current cost book derivation logic.


**•** Apply Pricing Adjustments (PricingAdjustmentsExtensionPoint): Get pricing adjustments for

a product offering from another data source, or extend the pricing engine logic by not
relying on the Standard Adjustment and Component Configuration Rule Matrices to get
the adjustment values.


To learn more, see Use extension points in Pricing Management.

#### **Product configurator**


The product configurator is a user interface that is embedded in various Sales and Order
Management applications, such as the Opportunity, Quote, and Order Management
applications, enabling agents to configure complex products or services dynamically
according to customer requirements.


**Note:** Check your entitlements to determine if you have access to this feature.


The interface consists of three main sections:


**• Product hierarchy** : Lists the parent and child product relationships for configurable

products. Product hierarchies are configured using relationships and relationship groups.
These hierarchies help agents navigate the product at different nodes or levels within
a nested bundle. To learn more about how to configure this section of the product
configurator, see Create product offering relationships.


**• Option selection** : Displays the product options or product characteristic options that

can be selected. Characteristics and characteristic options are configured as you build
your product offerings and appear in the product configurator. As your agents use the
interface, visual indicators, alert messages, and contextual information about their entries
are also displayed to help agents complete the order. For more information on configuring
these options, see Create product characteristics and characteristic options.


**• Current selection** : Shows the pricing for the options that you select, which are calculated

automatically and displayed. Pricing for selected options is shown and grouped as bundles
as applicable. Also shown are the subtotals and total based on the recurring and one-time
pricing methods. See Configuring product pricing for more information.


As an admin, you can use product configurator extension points and methods provided with
the Open state management framework to customize the product configurator interface. To
learn more about the framework, see Open state management.

#### **Lead to Cash Core**


Create the Sales and Order Management workflows for a product and service through
entity configurations and mappings. By creating this workflow, your organization can analyze
lucrative business opportunities, customer leads, and the billing, support, and maintenance
requirements after a sale is complete.


**Workflows overview**


A product goes through multiple phases and workflows from the time that a product is
identified to the time that it’s purchased by the customer. The workflow includes the creation
of a quote for a product or services, the creation of orders, the sold products, the install base
items, and the contracts and entitlements.


If you're an administrator, you create the workflows for your organization and configure
the metadata for your various lead-to-cash entities by activating the foundational Lead to
Cash Core (com.snc.l2c_core) application. With the Lead to Cash Core (com.snc.l2c_core)
plugin, you can compose and build the workflows that your organization maintains for the
life cycle of a sold product. For example, on the Lead to Cash Entities Mapping form on the
ServiceNow AI Platform [®], you select the sold product entity as a source entity and the order
as a target entity. You then map these entities and configurations to create a source to
the target flow that is a sold product to order flow. This mapping provides your users with a
unified workflow experience across the different entities.


**Note:** An entity is defined as a collection of tables that have information about an
order. The information can come from multiple tables.


**Entity configurations**


You can configure the definition of a lead-to-cash entity by defining a name and
configuration ID on the Lead to Cash Entity form. The definition creates a back and forth flow
of the information between the various entities.


To learn how to create entity configurations, see Create an entity configuration. To learn how
to create entity mappings, see Create an entity mapping.

**Reconfiguration**


You can reconfigure an order or a quote that is in the **Draft** state to make customizations in
the Configurator UI. After the configuration is complete, all the order line items associated
[with the order are also updated. To learn more about reconfiguration, see LeadtoCashCore -](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=LeadToCashCoreAPI&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-api-reference)
[Scoped](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=LeadToCashCoreAPI&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-api-reference) .

#### **Quote Management**


Quote Management is an application used to create and manage product and service
quotes. Quote Management can be a separate application or part of the Sales and Order
Management (SOM) application.


A quote is a formal offer for products and services, proposed at specific prices and related
payment terms, which is sent to a prospective customer or consumer. In the context of
Sales and Order Management, quotes can be created from the Opportunity Management
application or quotes can be created separately, depending on your configuration.

**Integrate Quote Management with product offering catalogs**


Quote Management is integrated with the product catalog and pricing to make adding
products to your quote easier and convenient. Agents use the catalog to browse product
offerings and the product configurator to add options and pricing to your products. Then
they simply add them to the quote. Pricing adjustments that are fetched based on pricing
matrices rules are automatically added and presented in the quote.


**Use the product configurator**


The product configurator lets your agents configure products in the following ways:


**•** Browse and add configurable product offerings from the catalog to create quote lines.


**•** Select product options and view product relationships.


The product configurator uses Sales and Order Management primitives to create and
update quote lines and characteristics.


**Configure and create quote line items**

updated in the Catalog tab for Quote Management. The product configurator uses Quote
Management primitives to create and update quote lines and characteristics.


**Add pricing adjustments to quotes**


Quote Management integrates with the pricing engine to get the list price and price
adjustments for the product offers in your quote.


Auto-pricing adjustments are fetched from the pricing engine. Manual pricing adjustments
are added by the agent.


Pricing adjustments include markups, markdowns, and price overrides. Total Adjustments are
applied to each line item with the cumulative total from each line rolled up to total.


Quote Management lets sales agents add the following types of manual pricing adjustments:


**•** Markup amount - add a markup amount to a product.


**•** Markdown amount - add a markdown amount to a product.


**•** Markup % - add a markup percentage to a product.

#### **Sales Agreement Management**


Sales Agreement Management is an application that captures the scope and conditions
from a quote for future sales transactions, over a specified period between a buyer and a
seller.


Sales Agreement Management can be a separate application or part of the Sales and
Order Management application.


A quote is a formal offer for products and services, proposed at specific prices and related
payment terms, which is sent to a prospective customer. Only after a quote is completed or
closed, a sales agreement can be generated.


**•** Details about the buyer and seller involved in the transaction


**•** Validity period of the agreement


**•** Details of the products and services to be supplied


**•** Specific products and services : Quantities and pricing


**Sales agreement workflow: Quote-to-sales agreement**


Sales agreement and Sales agreement lines are based on quote and quote lines using the
same product offerings .

**Sales agreement line items**


In a sales agreement, a line item refers to any product or service being sold by the seller.
These offerings can range from simple items to more complex ones that are configurable
or bundled together. Each offering may also have specific features or characteristics. A
line item might be a particular version of a product, a combination of different product
configurations, or a category of products. A single agreement can include multiple line
items.


**Sales agreement price list**


In a sales agreement, the prices for products and services that are negotiated and finalized
are called price lists. These lists specify the agreed-upon prices for various items included in
the agreement. When a sales order is placed based on a sales agreement, these price lists
are used to determine the pricing of the order. This ensures that the terms negotiated in the
sales agreement are consistently applied to all sales transactions under that agreement.

ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries.
Other company names, product names, and logos may be trademarks of the respective companies with which they are associated.


**•** Direct order capture - Your agents and order managers can enter product or

service orders using the CSM Configurable Workspace.


**•** If you're using the Order Management for Telecommunications, Media,

and Technology application and have a Telecommunications Service
Management subscription, you can use the following features:


**◦** Product and Service Order Open APIs - Use the ServiceNow implementation

of the TMF Open APIs to capture product and service orders from third-party
systems.


**◦** Now Service Exchange integrations - Use the Service Exchange applications

to receive and fulfill product or service requests directly between your
instance and the instances of your customers, without configuring and
maintaining custom integrations. Service Exchange supports the verification,
enrichment, decomposition, and fulfillment of these customer orders.
For information on the detailed benefits of using the Service Exchange
[applications, see Exploring Service Bridge](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=service-bridge-v2-exploring-service-bridge&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-service-bridge) .


If you're a provider, you can use the Service Bridge Order Management
for Providers application to create and fulfill product orders using Order
Management over Service Exchange. For information on using this
application to create the products that Service Exchange consumers
can order from service catalogs in their ServiceNow instances, see Order
Management for providers with Service Bridge.


After an order is captured, your order agents can add other required order
details, such as delivery location or pricing as part of order enrichment.


Order decomposition


After a fulfillment manager reviews and approves a product or service order,
Order Management breaks down the order into the required product, service,
and resource orders for each order line item. This breakdown is based on the

specification relationships set in the product catalog and any decomposition
rules that you created. If some of the information isn’t available when order
decomposition starts, Order Management can stagger the decomposition to
create certain orders using the current information.


Order fulfillment


Your fulfillment agents and managers complete the series of tasks needed to
fulfill an order, based on an orchestration plan that defines the order tasks for
fulfillment. You can use different tools to handle issues during fulfillment:


**•** Inflight change order management - Handle customer order changes.


**•** Fallout Management - Identify and resolve order processing errors.


**•** Jeopardy Management - Alert fulfillment managers when the assigned time

for an order task is in jeopardy.


Business Portal for customer self-service


Business customers can use the Business Portal to do the following:


**•** Browse products using the product catalog.


**•** Configure product options for complex products.


**•** Create orders and view products in their shopping carts.


**•** Review the fulfillment process to check the progress of their orders.

**Order Management data model**


The Order Management data model provides a framework that enables you to capture,
manage, orchestrate, and fulfill customer orders and external service orders for products and
services.


**Order life cycle**


In Order Management, a customer order moves through the various stages of an order's life
cycle.


**Order life cycle**

|Stage|Description|
|---|---|
|Customer order|Main order entity that is captured and<br>created for managing the end-to-end life<br>cycle of a customer request for products or<br>services.|
|Enrichment|Additional information that is required<br>for the order decomposition and for the<br>fulfillment process. Attributes and elements<br>can be added to orders that are required for<br>downstream applications, such as billing or<br>activation.|
|Decomposition|Order that is split into multiple suborders for<br>fulfillment.|
|Orchestration|Order fulfillment coordination that uses a<br>fulfillment flow.|



**Order enrichment and decomposition process**


A customer order can have one or more order line items. The enrichment and decomposition
process creates the required product, service, and resource order for each order line item,
using the specification relationship information in the Product Catalog. The following diagram
is an example of how a customer order can be enriched and decomposed.

**Order enrichment and decomposition process**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-31-0.png)


The fulfillment plan uses decision tables to match the flow for a product order. The assigned
flow then triggers the required order fulfillment tasks.


The following diagram shows how the fulfillment process works for a telecommunications
product order.


**Order fulfillment workflow example**

**Jeopardy Management**


Jeopardy Management is a risk assessment tool that monitors fulfillment tasks, assesses the risk
level, and alerts fulfillment managers when the assigned task time is in jeopardy.


Jeopardy Management consists of multiple components in the Order Management
application that work together to monitor and report on task completion time in a fulfillment
plan.


If a task is taking longer than expected, the system assesses the percentage of delay and
assigns a risk level.

In Order Management, some customer orders are expected to be fulfilled within a
committed time frame. The time commitment may be part of a contract that the customer
and customer service provider (CSP) have signed to ensure delivery and assurance of
products and services. To fulfill an order within the target date and time, a CSP depends
on order management systems to monitor the fulfillment progress. Jeopardy Management
proactively identities any delays and shares alerts, which can be addressed by fulfillment

managers.


**Overview of Jeopardy Management**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-32-0.png)


**How Jeopardy Management works**


Jeopardy Management works by tracking tasks in an order fulfillment process. Order task
relationships are created and task durations are set. Planned tasks are set in the Draft state
and have a start time and an end time. As an order task is being fulfilled, any delays within
the task's assigned amount of time triggers a jeopardy alert.


**Jeopardy Management components**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-32-1.png)


**Jeopardy Management alert levels**


In Jeopardy Management, the fulfillment manager can set different levels of alerts for each
task. As the system monitors task duration, any delay triggers adjustments to the jeopardy
level of predecessor and successor tasks in the fulfillment plan.


The following image shows several Jeopardy Management configuration examples.

**Jeopardy Management scenarios**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-33-0.png)


The Jeopardy Management scenarios image compares some scenarios for tasks at certain
risk levels: expected, on-time, and delayed. Jeopardy Management assesses all the tasks in a
workflow and adjusts the risk level for tasks that occur later in the workflow.

**Horizontal relationships between products**


By using a compatibility rule, you can define the horizontal relationships between your
product, service, and resource specifications.


When you create a product catalog, you can create a vertical relationship, which is the
relationship between your parent and child entities. As a product catalog manager, you can
also enable a horizontal relationship, which is a relationship between a product to product,
product to service, or product to resource, by defining compatibility rules in the product
catalog.


**Using a horizontal relationship**


The compatibility rules include the horizontal relationships between your product, service,
and resource specifications. Your customers can place orders for enterprise products where
a product can depend on another product in the same or different product offering, like a
sibling or a peer.


Let's look at an example of a horizontal relationship, such as the relationship between the
Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and an internet service. VoIP requires an active internet
connection but VoIP and an internet service are defined in a different product hierarchy.
With a horizontal relationship, you can define a relationship between VoIP and an internet
service in the product catalog to support the order creation process for VoIP and to fulfill the
order.


**Orders for 5G sliced networks**


A communication service provider (CSP) can define 5G services in the technical catalog
and manage the creation and fulfillment of these orders for a sliced network.

**Network slicing**


Network slicing refers to a method of partitioning a physical network into multiple, separate
networks. These separate networks are called slices.


By slicing a 5G network, a CSP can do the following tasks:


**•** Create and manage the slice templates with the required slice attributes in their product

catalog.


**•** Support slice specifications by using the slice templates to define the slice services.


**•** Support the ingestion of slice orders from external systems through the existing product

order API.


**•** Decompose the slice orders and trigger the fulfillment workflows for the decomposed

orders.


**•** Trigger the southbound slice orders with southbound attributes toward southbound systems,

such as Network Slice Management Function (NSMF), by using the service order open API.


**How a slicing order is managed**


A product catalog administrator creates templates in the product catalog by defining the
template characteristics and template characteristic options. When the product catalog
administrator is finished creating the templates, they publish it to the product catalog. With
this process, the product catalog administrator can create templates for the various types of
slices with the slice attributes and attribute values for the 5G network services.


Next, the product catalog administrator maps the slice templates with the various
specification categories. The product catalog administrator does the mapping by using
the Template Selection Policy decision table in the Decision Builder. The mapped templates
are automatically filled in the service specification form when a user selects a specification
category. For a description of the Service specifications form fields, see .


**Note:**


**•** If a specification category is mapped with multiple templates, the latest published

template is considered to be in the service specification.


**•** If a specification category is not mapped with any templates, the default category
template mapping is considered to be in the service specification.


The product catalog manager then uses the templates to define the new specifications for
the 5G services.


After the 5G service specifications are created, they can be used in the slice order creation
and fulfillment process. The 5G slice ordering process follows the existing order approval,
decomposition, and fulfillment process in the Order Management application.

#### **Customer Contracts and Entitlements**


The Customer Contracts and Entitlements application for Customer Service Management
(CSM) provides solution to standardize, organize, manage, and use contracts and
entitlements.


**Customer Contracts and Entitlements overview**


You can use the Customer Contracts and Entitlements application to manage contracts
from the initial offer to contract finalization, directly within the CSM Configurable Workspace.

modifications, and cancellations. The application enables tracking of entitlements and
improves contract compliance.


A customer contract acts as an agreement between the customer and the organization. A
contract includes the consumer or account details, the products covered, and the contract
term. Contract lines store information related to the product or services purchased as a part
of the contract.


Contracts and entitlement workflows help in efficiently managing the complete life cycle
of customer contracts and entitlements. The workflows in this application enable you to
generate, modify, and renew contracts and entitlements.

#### **Partner Relationship Management**


Learn how the Partner Relationship Management application enables enterprises to hire
and engage channel partners to sell their products and services to grow and improve their
business.


**Overview of Partner Relationship Management**


Channel partners streamline and help manage the sales process of a product or a service for
an enterprise. The PRM solution offers tools to manage the end-to-end partner life cycle.


PRM enables an efficient and continuous partner engagement and collaboration system
with the enterprise to provide essential support. The PRM system enables partner onboarding,
life cycle management, and improves the overall collaboration between channel partners
and enterprises. To learn how to configure Partner Relationship Management, see Configure
Partner Relationship Management.


The collaboration improves case management solutions and enables partners to log in to the
Partner Portal to raise concerns or queries and communicate directly with the enterprise. This
provides better resolutions leading to improved enterprise and partner collaboration.


In the partner ecosystem, channel partners such as resellers and system integrators are
critical to expanding an enterprise's reach and drive customer success. Channel partners
often must raise operations, sales, and service related issues directly with the enterprise.
However, without a structured servicing and collaboration system, partners experience
delays, inefficiencies, and friction that impact both partner satisfaction and business
outcomes. The PRM solution can build a bridge between the channel partners and
enterprises.


**Use case**


ABC systems, a global technology reseller and implementation channel partner for XYZ
solutions (enterprise), operates across North America with hundreds of active customer

By streamlining support and collaboration through PRM, ABC reduces its resolution time,
improves internal efficiency, and strengthens its partnership with XYZ.


**Key benefits of PRM**


The Partner Relationship Management solution offers the following benefits.


**•** Enhances partner experience- Support partner onboarding and life cycle management

to provide an improved interaction system between channel partners and enterprises. This
increases partner satisfaction and reduces onboarding time.


**•** Increase sales and revenue- Streamline and improve collaboration between enterprises

and their partners to increase partner sales and performance to enable higher partnerinitiated revenue and efficient deal conversion rates.


**•** Increase operational efficiency- Provide visibility into the partner ecosystem and enable

partners to achieve their business goal to decrease manual intervention and increase
partner self-service.

#### **Configuring product offerings and catalogs**

Create product offerings and the associated product catalogs that can be used by Sales
and Order Management agents for pre-sales activities, order capture, and post-sales
engagement.


As a product catalog administrator or catalog manager, you complete various configuration
tasks to create the product catalogs and offerings for products and services sold by your
organization. You also work with your pricing administrator, who sets the pricing for your
product offerings. For more information on pricing, see Configuring product pricing.


The following workflow example shows a typical series of steps for setting up catalogs
and product offerings, including the pricing configuration tasks performed by your pricing
administrator. Some steps may be optional in your organization, and other steps, such as
setting up product relationships between catalog entities, may occur in a slightly different

sequence.

**Activate the display of product catalog visuals**


Turn on the display of product images shown in the product tiles of product catalogs by using
the _`sn_prd_pm.show_product_visuals_on_catalog_ui`_ system property.


**Before you begin**
Role required: admin


**About this task**
The _`sn_prd_pm.show_product_visuals_on_catalog_ui`_ system property controls the
images displayed in commercial product catalogs. This property doesn’t apply to service
catalogs or product inventory catalogs.


**Procedure**


**1.** Navigate to **All** and in the filter enter `sys_properties.list` .


**2.** Open the _`sn_prd_pm.show_product_visuals_on_catalog_ui`_ system property.


**3.** In the **Value** field, enter `true` to activate the display of product offering images in the

product catalog.


**4.** Select **Update** .

The product offering visuals are loaded in the catalog. If a product offering doesn't have a
visual, the text **Image not available** is presented in the product offering tile instead.


**Control cascading quantity values in child product offerings**


Control how the quantities for child line items in a product offering for an opportunity, quote,
or order are calculated by using the _`sn_prd_pm.enable_cascade_quantity`_ system
property.


**Before you begin**
Role required: admin


**About this task**
The _`sn_prd_pm.enable_cascade_quantity`_ system property, if enabled, automatically
cascades the quantity value for a top-level offer to child lines, when the quantity for the toplevel offer is greater than 1. For example, when an agent creates an opportunity, quote,
or order for a configurable offer and updates the quantity so that it’s greater than 1, the
quantity on the child line items is multiplied by the quantity for the top-level offer. Pricing
for the child lines is based on the cascaded quantity. If you use the quantity on the child
offers as the total quantity ordered, using cascading quantities considers the quantity on the
parent offer as well.


However, if you consider the quantity on the child offer as the quantity of the child offer per
one quantity of the parent offer, you might not want cascading quantity values.

**Note:** If you're upgrading from a release before the November 2024 release, this
property is enabled by default. If you don't want the quantity values to be cascaded to
child lines, suppress this feature by setting the property to false.


**Procedure**


**1.** Navigate to **All** and in the filter enter `sys_properties.list` .


**2.** Open the _`sn_prd_pm.enable_cascade_quantity`_ system property.


**3.** Set the property value for the cascading quantity feature in the **Value** field.


**◦** Enter `true` to activate this property.


**◦** Enter `false` to suppress this property if it's currently enabled.


**4.** Select **Update** .

If you enabled this property, quantity values are cascaded to the child lines for product
offers. If you suppressed this property, quantity values are not cascaded to the child lines
for product offers.


**Create product offerings**


Create and publish a product offering used in Sales and Order Management. Product
offerings represent entities that are orderable from the provider of the catalog and includes
pricing information. Once published, product offerings are available to agents as they create
leads, opportunities, quotes, and orders and to customers placing orders.

**•** Add product catalog categories


**•** Add related contracts to product offerings


**•** Add a unit of measure to a product offering


**•** Create a product offering version


**•** Create product offering relationship groups


**Defining product characteristics and characteristic options**


As a product catalog admin, you create the characteristics and characteristic options for
product offerings and specifications. Product characteristics are attributes that define and
describe a product.


For example, if a product offering is a bike, the characteristics might include bike size and
color. The characteristic options are the choices, such as the various bike sizes and colors
available. Characteristics and characteristic options for products are displayed in the
product configurator when agents configure products for opportunities, quotes, and orders
and when customers order products using the Business Portal.

**Characteristic data input types**


When you define product characteristics and characteristic options, you provide basic
attribute information, including the characteristic name and the data input type for the
characteristic options. The data input type indicates how the characteristic options are
entered in the product configurator, such as single line text or choice selection.


The following data input types are available for characteristic options:


**•** Address - Mail address


**•** Attachment - External document to be attached


**•** CheckBox - Select or clear an option


**•** Choice - Options that can be chosen, presented as radio buttons or available from a drop
down list


**•** Decimal - Numbers that require a decimal point to indicate fractional amounts


**•** Dates - Date picker for selecting day, month, and year


**•** Date/time - Date picker for selecting day, month, year and time of day


**•** Duration - Period of time


**•** Email - Email address


**•** Single Line Text - Free-form text


**•** Integers - Whole numbers


**•** Yes/No - Yes/no response


**•** Object - Structure that represents a hierarchy of attributes, also called complex

characteristics. An object has parent attribute with one or more child attributes.


**•** Arrays - Multiple instances of the same attribute type, such as arrays of Date, DateTime,

Integer, Single Line Text, Object, and Decimal


You can use the Object type to build a hierarchy of complex characteristics, which has a
top-level parent attribute with one or more child attributes. The child characteristics can be
any of the data input types, including objects with data arrays.


The following example shows a characteristic hierarchy for Routing Addresses, which is
a parent-level attribute with an object data type. This attribute has the following child
attributes: Procurement Date, Route, Additional Address Required, BGP, Routing Type,
and Address Supplier. Notice that the BGP child characteristic is an array of objects with a
minimum size of 2 and maximum size of 4.

**Example of complex characteristics in product configurator**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-55-0.png)


**Setting up complex characteristics**


Defining a hierarchical attribute structure involves setting up the parent attribute, for
example routing addresses, as an object type. You then define the characteristic
relationships between the parent attribute and child attributes to establish the hierarchical
structure and the order in which the child characteristics display in the product configurator.


For details on defining characteristics, see Create product characteristics and characteristic
options


.


**Create product characteristics and characteristic options**


Add product characteristics and characteristic options that you can later add to your
product offerings in Sales and Order Management.


**Before you begin**
Role required: sn_prd_pm_product_catalog_admin


**About this task**
Use this procedure to build product characteristics (also called attributes) and characteristic
options, which you add to product offerings and specifications. For example, if the product
offering is a bike, characteristics might include bike size and color. The characteristic options
are the option choices, such as the various bike sizes and colors available. These options
appear in the product configurator when your agents add configurable products to
opportunities, quotes, and orders or when customers submit product orders using the Business
Portal.


When you define a characteristic, you select the data input type, which indicates how the
characteristic option is entered in the product configurator, such as Single Line Text, Choice
(radio buttons or drop-down list), and Yes/No selections. Complex data input types are also
available to define complex characteristics that have hierarchical attribute structures. You
use the object data type to define complex characteristics, which have a top-level parent
attribute and associated child characteristics. These structures can also include data arrays,
another complex data type that you can use to specify multiple instances of the same data
input type, such as multiple lines of text or integers.

**Create configurable product offerings and associated blueprints**


Create a configurable product offering and generate an associated blueprint used by the
ServiceNow CPQ configurator. A blueprint contains the product structure and includes the
product attributes, product relationships, product and pricing rules, and any child products
for the offering. Blueprints drive the agent and customer experience for configuring products
in the CPQ Configurator.


**Before you begin**
Role required: sn_prd_pm_product_catalog_admin


**About this task**
A configurable product offering also called a complex product offering, has multiple
characteristics and one or more product relationships. The process of creating a
configurable product offering involves defining the product in Product Catalog
Management, then generating the blueprint. The blueprint is used in ServiceNow CPQ to
manage the product configuration experience for agents and customers.


**Note:** Contact your ServiceNow account representative to obtain ServiceNow CPQ.


**Procedure**


**1.** Create the configurable product offering.


**a.** In the CSM Configurable Workspace, select the **List** view.


**b.** Create an offering or copy an existing offering to create an offering.


**▪** To create an offering, navigate to **Offerings**         - **Product Offerings** and select **New** .


**▪** To copy an offering, navigate to **Offerings**         - **Product Offerings**, select the offering to be

copied, and select **Copy** .


**c.** In the Details tab, fill in the fields to create a configurable product or modify the copy to

create a product.

**Note:** For details on completing the form, see Create product offerings. To identify
the offering as a configurable product, select the **Configurable** option in the
form, even if there are no characteristics or relationships defined. Selecting the
**Configurable** option indicates that the product offering is to be configured using
the CPQ Configurator.


**d.** Select **Save** .


The **Create Configuration** button displays. The Record Information pane shows the
synchronization state, which is _`Sync Not Initiated`_ .


**2.** Start the synchronization process by selecting **Create Configuration** .

The synchronization process begins, as indicated by the synchronization state _`Sync`_
_`initiated`_ . The synchronization process creates the blueprint for the offering. If you
previously defined attributes, product relationships and groups, and other product or
pricing rules for the offering, that information is included in the blueprint.


When the synchronization completes, the status changes to _`Sync success`_ . The
Configuration Setup tab (related list) displays the blueprint. The **Update configuration** and
**Publish** buttons are also displayed.


**Note:** If the synchronization fails, use the Configuration Errors tab (related list) to view
the errors in the synchronization process.


The product blueprint has the following features:

|Blueprint feature|Description|
|---|---|
|Associated Fields|Attributes and attribute types.|
|Related Rules|Product and pricing rules.|
|Layouts|Arrangement of the elements displayed in the<br>configurator interface. A default layout is applied<br>during synchronization, but you can change the<br>layout.|
|Configurable Products|Child products of the offering.|
|Enrichments|Scripts used by the rules engine to retrieve<br>external data such as pricing or product data.|



For more information on blueprints and how you can use them, see the online help
accessible in the interface.


**Note:** If you defined rules and attributes in Product Catalog Management, those
rules and attributes must be updated in Product Catalog Management and not in the
blueprint. However you can add new rules and fields using the blueprint.


**3.** If you want to make further changes to the product offering, and the offering is still in Draft

state, select **Update configuration** and change the offering details.


**4.** When you're ready to publish the offering, select _Publish_ .

Another synchronization occurs, and the product offering is published to the product
catalog.


**5.** Update the blueprint so that it has the latest business logic changes (rules) and other data,

such as pricing, for the product.

**Defining transient products**


When you create product offerings and technical specifications, you can identify single-use
products and services as transient, to differentiate them from persistent products. Examples of
one-time use products include installation or consulting services.


When new orders with transient products are submitted for fulfillment in ServiceNow [® ] Order
Management, the sold product or product inventory records are created with an Installation
pending state. After new orders with transient products are fulfilled, the sold product or
product inventory state changes to Inactive. Your fulfillment managers can then quickly
see which products aren’t part of the active inventory. Agents can’t perform Move, Add,
Change, Delete (MACD) actions on inactive sold product or product inventory records.


**Guidelines for defining transient products**


When you’re defining product offerings, use the **Transient** option in the Create New Product
Offering form to identify a transient product. If the product has associated technical
specifications, you also set the **Transient** option in the appropriate Product, Service, and
Resource Specification forms.


When defining transient products, note the following restrictions:


**•** Create New Product Offering form: The **Transient** option and the **Create contract** option

can't be enabled at the same time for the product.


**•** Parent and child product offerings: Transient parent product offerings and parent

specifications must have transient child product offerings and child specifications.
However, non-transient parent product offerings and parent specifications can have
transient child product offerings and child product specifications.


**•** Linking product offerings to product specifications: A transient product offering must be

linked to a transient product specification and vice versa.


**•** Specification relationships: When defining specification relationships for a transient product,

you can associate only a transient service specification or resource specification. Transient
product orders are decomposed as indicated in the associated specification.


For details on setting the **Transient** option for product offerings and specifications, see the
following sections:


**•** Create product offerings

**•**


**•** Create and publish service specifications

**•**


**Multiple configurations**


As a product catalog manager, when you define a configurable product offering, you can
enable agents to add multiple configurations of a child product offering. When agents add
multiple configurations, they can change the quantity for each configuration of the offering,
define each configuration as a separate line item, and select the appropriate options and
characteristics for each configuration.

**How multiple configurations work**


When you use the Create New Product Offering form to define configurable product
offerings and child product offerings, select the **Allow multiple configurations** option to
enable the creation of multiple child offering configurations. For information on defining
product offerings, see Create product offerings.


**Note:** If the configurable product has an associated product specification, the **Allow**
**multiple configurations** option is enabled automatically and can't be unselected.


When agents add configurable products to new opportunities, quotes, and orders, they can
create multiple configurations for a child offering. They navigate to a summary page for a
selected child offering. From this page, they can do the following:


**•** Change the quantity of a child offering.


**•** Clone a child offering.


**•** Split a child offering that has a quantity greater than 1, to create child offering instances

with different quantities.


Each offering instance becomes a new line item that can be configured separately.


In the following example, the Home Automation Bundle is a child offering that has a default
quantity of 2 in the Quadplay Home Tech Bundle. An information icon displays next to each
child offering that can have multiple configurations. The information icon, when selected,
displays a message indicating that multiple configurations can be created for the child
offering.


**Example configurable product offering for an order**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-70-1.png)


**How multiple configurations are created**


When agents review a bundle offering in the product configurator, they identify the child
offerings that can have multiple configurations. They navigate to the summary page for the
appropriate child offering to create multiple configurations.


In the offering summary page, a message indicates that the offering supports multiple
configurations and the aggregated quantity of configurations that can be created. Agents
can change the quantity of the child offering on this page.


The More options icon displays next to the **Quantity** . Selecting the icon lists the options
available for creating and managing multiple configurations.

**Offering summary page with More options menu**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-71-0.png)


The following options are available to manage child offering configurations:


**• Clone** : Create child offering configurations by copying the selected child product offering

configuration. The agent is prompted to enter the number of clones to be made.


For example, if the current child offering quantity is 2, and the agent specifies 2 copies,
two identical copies of the child product offering are created. Each clone becomes a
separate line item and has a quantity of 1.


**• Split** : Create child offering configurations by splitting the current child offering quantity and

distributing the quantity evenly across all the copies. The agent is prompted to enter the
number of splits.


For example, if the child offering quantity is 5, and an agent specifies 3 splits, two child
offering instances are created. After the split, there are three child offering instances,
where the instances have a quantity of 2, 2, and 1, respectively.


**• Delete** : Removes the child offering instance. If deleting a child offering instance causes

the number of child offers to fall below the minimum quantity defined for the product, the
**Delete** option isn’t available.


When the child offering configurations are created, each offering name reflects the child
product offering name followed by an incremental number. For example, Home Automation
Hub configurations are named Home Automation Hub 2, Home Automation Hub 3, and so
on. Agents can then select the appropriate offering instance to configure it. If the agent
changes the **Quantity** value, the Current Selection pane reflects the new quantity and
associated pricing.


**Validation during multiple configuration creation**


As your agents create multiple configurations, the system uses the default, minimum, and
maximum cardinality rules defined for the product offering to validate the configurations. If
there are violations, the system displays the appropriate information and error messages in
the product configurator UI.

Other company names, product names, and logos may be trademarks of the respective companies with which they are associated.


The system also uses the cardinality rules to determine when certain configuration options
( **Split** and **Delete** ) should be enabled or turned off, based on the context. For example, if
the minimum child offering quantity is 1 and a child offering has a quantity of 1, the system
disables the **Delete** option in the More options menu.


**Limitations for multiple configurations**


Multiple configurations aren’t supported for quotes of type sales agreements. Also, changes
for quotes and orders with sold products or product inventory have the following limitations:


**•** Sold products: When creating a modify order, the **Delete** option for multiple configurations

is supported, but the **Clone** and **Split** options aren’t supported.


**•** Product inventory: Multiple configurations are supported. The **Split** option isn’t supported.


**Setting up multiple configurations**


For details on enabling and creating multiple configurations for child offerings, see the
following sections:


**•** Create product offerings


**•** Create multiple configurations


**Setting up specifications and product offerings**


By creating and publishing versioned specifications and product offerings in a technical
product catalog, your customers can order up-to-date versions of the products or services
that they require. Your product catalog manager can create versions of the published
specifications and product offerings with the required enhancements to support your
customer's business, marketing, manufacturing, or operational changes.


**Overview of product offerings with specifications**


As a product catalog manager, you set up product offerings in a technical product catalog.
A product offering contains the product description, pricing, eligibility, and product options.
You use a product catalog to group your product offerings so that your customers can order
the products or services that they want. Only published product offerings can be added to
customer contracts.


The relationship between product offerings and the product, service, and resource
specification determine how a product is fulfilled. For example, the following diagram shows
the relationships between the product offerings, the product specification, the service
specification, and the resource specification for an SD-WAN product model.

**Product offer bundling with product specifications**


Product Catalog Management supports the bundling of product offers that have associated
product specifications or specification hierarchies at any level of the bundle.


**Supported product offer bundles**


As a product catalog admin or manager, you can create a bundle offer for the following
product offer combinations:


**•** A top-level offer with several offers in multiple levels, but no product specification

reference at any level.


**•** A top-level offer with several offers in multiple levels that can have a product specification

reference at any level.


**•** A top-level offer with two or three levels of nesting, where the leaf-level product offer

references a specification hierarchy.


When offer bundles that have a specification reference at different levels are added to
a quote or an order, the appropriate transaction lines are generated with specification
references and product offer references. If fulfillment is done in ServiceNow Order
Management, the applicable domain orders are generated and records for sold products
and product inventory are created or updated.


**Characteristics inherited from product specifications**


When you create a product offering and reference a product specification hierarchy,
you can select an option called **Copy child specification characteristics** . When you
select this option, the product offer inherits all the characteristics from the specification
or specification hierarchy. For example, if a product offer has an associated product
specification, the characteristics are inherited from the child specifications in addition to the
parent specification. The attributes from parent specification are always inherited by the
product offer.


You can also do the following when you create a bundle product offering:


**•** Add other characteristics to the offering, such as attributes for order enrichment, aside

from characteristics inherited from the specification.


**•** Delete product offering characteristics that were inherited from the specification.


To learn more about product offerings, see Create product offerings.


**Product catalog hierarchy visualization**


As a product catalog admin or manager, you can view the complete hierarchy of a product
offering and any associated specifications (product, service, and resource). Use these views
to verify that all entities have been defined and associated correctly.


For product offerings that have associated specifications, you can toggle the hierarchical
view of the product offering to show its specification hierarchy. The hierarchical specification
view shows the services that enable the product to be realized and the resources that
are required to deliver those services. This view helps you visualize different aspects of a
product offering, to validate the product and determine that the supporting services and
resources are designed as needed. The hierarchy also highlights any relationships between
specifications.

**Product catalog hierarchy views**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-80-0.png)


To view the product catalog hierarchy in the CSM Configurable Workspace, in the List view
navigate to **Offerings**    - **Product Offerings** . Select a product offering, then select the Catalog
Hierarchy tab. Use the **Show specification** toggle to switch between the product offering and
specification hierarchical views.


The toggle legend identifies the product offering and specification icons displayed in the
visualization. Similar to the selection of specification nodes, when you select any product
offer node, the side panel displays the high-level details of the product offer. You can use the
filter to select a node and display the hierarchy under the node rather than the whole tree.


**Configuring product offer eligibility**


You can filter the product catalog, offering categories, and product offerings dynamically,
to display only the appropriate catalog, categories, and offerings for which a customer is
eligible. Your agents see this filtered product information when they're creating opportunities,
quotes, and orders.


**Product offer eligibility overview**


As a product catalog admin or manager, you create the business rules that filter the product
catalogs, offering categories, and product offerings to display only the eligible products for
customers when agents are creating quotes or orders. Filtering the products helps agents sell
the correct products to customers. The filters are based on decision rules that you set in the
following product eligibility matrices:


**• Product Offering Catalog Eligibility** : Define the eligibility rules to be applied to product

offering catalogs. For example, you can use this matrix to filter sales catalogs based on
customer location, such as country, state, or city.


**• Product Offering Category Eligibility** : Define the eligibility rules to be applied to product

offering categories.


**• Product Offering Eligibility** : Define the eligibility rules to be applied to product offerings.

These matrices are frameworks for setting the conditions and the context variables that
control the catalogs, product categories, and product offerings displayed. You can use
system-defined context variables provided with Product Catalog Management and Pricing
Management, or you can work with your admin to develop your own custom context
variables, such as marketing segment or sales channel, to be used in the eligibility matrices.

**About this task**
When you define eligibility rules, consider the two modes for determining eligibility:


**•** Ineligible: Determine all the catalogs, categories, and product offers that are considered

ineligible by default, then set your eligibility rules as needed.


**•** Eligible: Determine all the catalogs, categories, and product offers that are considered

eligible by default, then set your ineligibility rules as needed.


Use the **Default result** field in the decision table for the product eligibility matrix to control the
default mode.


The November 2024 release provides Version 2 of the product eligibility matrices, which now
support eligibility rules based on transaction line attributes. You can also use service location
context variables to set product eligibility rules for service locations: Service City, Service
State, Service Country, and Service Zip.

**Exporting and importing product catalog entities**


As a product catalog admin, you can both export and import product catalog entities
between ServiceNow instances. For example, you can promote catalog entities from a nonproduction instance to a production instance. Each process involves a separate set of steps.

Other company names, product names, and logos may be trademarks of the respective companies with which they are associated.


**Managing product catalog entities**


The first step before exporting product catalog entities is adding the **Code** field values to
product catalog entities. The **Code** field value is used by the system to determine whether an
entity is to be inserted or updated in the target instance.


You then choose the product catalog entities to be exported and run the export process.


After you export your product catalog entities, certain base entities must be imported first
to your target instance, such as characteristics, characteristic options, template, and Unit of
Measure (UOM), since they're referenced by product offerings, product specifications, and
service specifications. For this reason, import certain product catalog entities to your target
instance in the following order:


**1.** Import the exported base entities.


**2.** Import the product offering catalog if you're exporting product offerings.


**3.** Import product offerings and product specifications.


**Export and import process**


Follow these steps to export and import product catalog entities.


**Export and import product catalog steps**

|Step|Description|
|---|---|
|Add Code field values to catalog entities|Add the**Code**field values for the main<br>product catalog entities on your source and<br>target instances.|
|Export product catalog entities|Export product catalog entities from<br>one instance to another. The entities are<br>exported as JSON and are downloaded to<br>your local download directory.|
|View export job status|Check the state of the export job.|
|Import product catalog entities|Import product entities exported as JSON<br>files to another instance.|
|View import job status|Check the state of the import job.|



**Add Code field values to catalog entities**


Add the **Code** field values for the main product catalog entities. The system uses this field as
a way to identify catalog entities uniquely and to determine whether the **Code** field values
for an export catalog entity are to be inserted or updated in the target instance.


**Before you begin**
Role required: admin


**About this task**
The **Code** values for product catalog entities are system-assigned alphanumeric values
based on the catalog entity name, such as the name of a product offering. If the **Code** field
values for the main catalog entities are empty, run certain on-demand scheduled jobs and
fix scripts to add the **Code** field values for the main product catalog entities.


Both the scheduled jobs and fix scripts add the **Code** field values for the catalog entities.

**Caching in Product Catalog Management**


The Product Catalog Management application uses caching to improve user interface
performance when agents access product catalogs and product offerings through the
product configurator.


**Overview**


The product offering catalog and configurable product offerings have hierarchical structures
that require frequent database retrieval when they’re used. To improve performance, these
hierarchical structures are cached when you publish these features.


As a product catalog admin or manager, when you make the following changes to a
published product offering or product offering catalog, you must update the associated
cache so that you can immediately see the changes just made:


**• Unit of Measure** (UOM) in product offerings – Although product offerings cannot be

changed after you publish them, you can change the default **Unit of Measure** . After
updating the UOM, you must update the product offering cache.


**• Product offering catalog changes** – If you change the hierarchies for catalog to category

or category to sub-category hierarchies, you must update the product offering catalog
cache.


For details on regenerating these caches, see Update a cache in Product Catalog
Management.


**Update a cache in Product Catalog Management**


Regenerate the cache associated with product offerings or product offering catalogs after
changing the **Unit of Measure** in a product offering or category-related hierarchies in a
product offering catalog.

**Configuration JSON** .
The system immediately updates the associated cache for the product offering or product
offering catalog. You can then view the changes that you made to the **Unit of Measure** in
a product offering or the product offering catalog.


**Configuring needs analysis**


As a product catalog administrator, you can create needs templates, which are
questionnaires that agents use to find product offers to add to a lead or opportunity.
Questionnaires function as product selection guides. When agents complete a questionnaire
based on customer input, they get product recommendations that they can add to a lead
or opportunity.


**Overview of needs analysis**


When agents create a lead in the Lead Management application or an opportunity in the
Opportunity Management application, a product selection guide is displayed in the product
catalog. The product selection guide lists the needs templates that agents can choose to
get product offer recommendations.


**Elements of needs analysis**

Needs template


Product selection guides associated with the product catalog display one or
more needs templates. Each needs template is a questionnaire that has a set
of guided questions that agents answer to get product recommendations for a
customer. Each template is associated with a needs decision tree.


Needs decision tree


A multi-step, guided decision process that presents a series of questions to the
agent. You use Decision Tree Builder to create and build the decision tree.The
decision tree defines the question nodes, expected answers, connection points,
decision logic, and guidance for decision paths in the questionnaire.


Product recommendations


The product offerings suggested for an opportunity or lead, based on the results
of the needs questionnaire.


**Working with decision trees**


You configure decision trees by adding nodes, defining paths, and attaching guidances
in Decision Tree Builder. This tool is a canvas for diagramming the basic elements
in a decision tree, such as the question nodes and decision paths. Needs analysis
provides a default guidance, the Product Offering Recommendation guidance,
which references information from the Needs Based Offering Recommendation

[sn_prd_pm_product_offering_recommendation] table as you create the question nodes
and guidances in the decision tree.


Before creating decision trees for needs templates, review how decision trees work:


**•** [Decision trees in Guided decision](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=decision-trees-in-guided-decisions&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-customer-service-management)    - Learn the basic elements of a decision tree, such as
node types, linking inputs in nodes, and decision tree paths.


**•** [Example configuration of a decision tree](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=example-decision-tree&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-customer-service-management)    - Review an example decision tree, including
preparations for creating a decision tree, to understand the end-to-end configuration of a
decision tree.


**•** [Answer types for questions](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=type-of-answer&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-customer-service-management)    - Learn about the various types of answers to questions, such
as Choice, Date, or Integers.

Product pricing is used by your sales and order agents when creating opportunities, quotes,
and sales orders in Sales and Order Management.


**Pricing configuration overview**


As a pricing administrator or pricing manager, you complete various configuration tasks
and work with your product catalog administrator and product catalog manager to set
up the pricing for products and services sold by your organization. The following example
workflow shows the pricing configuration tasks and how they fit within product catalog and
product offering configuration. You can also work with your administrator to extend certain
pricing features, such as setting up pricing extension points to access pricing information from
external sources.

**Configurable pricing plans**


Pricing Management provides a default pricing plan that defines the sequence of steps in
which pricing calculations and adjustments are applied to determine final product prices.


**How the pricing plan works**


The default pricing plan is an active, published plan that is automatically implemented
starting with the November 2024 release. You can use the default plan, or you can copy
the default plan and customize it by adding or changing the pricing steps to tailor it for your
organization. You can have only one active pricing plan per domain.


**Note:** The Pricing Management v13.0 release provides a default pricing plan that
includes a new step, Apply Attribute-based Cost Adjustment. If you've been using a
custom pricing plan from an earlier release, review the default pricing plan, which is in
a Retired state after you upgrade to the v13.0 release. Determine whether you want to
publish the default plan or customize the default pricing plan for your needs and then
publish the custom plan to be used.

**Default Pricing Plan steps**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-102-0.png)


The default plan consists of basic pricing steps in which certain actions are run to calculate
product offering prices.


**Pricing steps**

|Step Action|Col2|
|---|---|
|Initialize Pricing Context|Starts the pricing engine context. The system<br>gathers basic data required for subsequent<br>calculation steps. For example, the system<br>resolves context variable values, initializes<br>the pricing cache, and performs basic<br>validation of request payloads.|
|Fetch Base Cost|Get costs from acost book, if your<br>organization is using cost books in Quote<br>Management.|
|Apply Attribute based Cost Adjustments|Apply adjustments to the cost based on<br>product offering characteristics.|
|Fetch Base List Price|Get the list price for all requested products<br>based on theprice list, unit of measurement,<br>and data provided to the pricing API.|
|Apply Attribute Adjustments|Apply attribute adjustments based on<br>product characteristics selected.|
|Apply Renewal Adjustment|Apply a renewal adjustment for contracts.<br>This step determines whether a markup or<br>markdown value, either a percentage or<br>specific amount, such as a pricing uplift for<br>contract renewals, is to be calculated and<br>applied.|

**Pricing steps (continued)**

|Step Action|Col2|
|---|---|
||**Note:**<br>**•** Subsequent pricing adjustment steps<br>in the pricing plan are not applied<br>after this renewal adjustment step.<br>**•** You can change or remove this<br>step in a custom pricing plan. You<br>can also change the conditions<br>for running subsequent steps after<br>the renewal adjustment step. For<br>details on changing conditions for a<br>particular step, seeAdd or change a<br>pricing plan step.|
|Apply configuration component adjustment|Apply adjustments as defined in the<br>Configuration Component Price Adjustment<br>Matrix for child product offerings that are<br>bundled under a parent product offering.|
|Apply contextual adjustments|Apply adjustments as defined in the<br>Standard Price Adjustment Matrix for<br>product offerings based on non-product<br>characteristics, such as billing state or<br>shipping zip code.|
|Custom adjustments|Apply custom adjustments if implemented<br>using the PricingAdjustmentExtensionPoint to<br>fetch adjustments from another system or for<br>adjustments that can't be supported via a<br>pricing matrix.|



For the configuration component adjustments, contextual adjustments, and custom
adjustments, the **Price point** and **Calculation type** values in a step determine how multiple
pricing adjustments are calculated:


**• Price point** : The price for a product or service that is calculated after the step is run, either

the List Price or Net Price.


**• Calculation type** : Method for evaluating the impact of the adjustment at each step. The

adjustment is applied to either the Previous Price Point or the Rolling Price.


**◦** When the Calculation Type is Previous Price Point and the price point is Net Price, the

previous price point is List Price. The adjustment is applied to the List Price.


**◦** When the Calculation Type is Rolling, the adjustment calculated is based on the output

of the previous step.


**Example pricing plan calculations**


The following example shows how multiple pricing adjustments in a pricing plan are
calculated and applied to a door sensor product. The door sensor is part of the Home
Automation bundled product, which is being sold to Boxeo, a customer in California. The
price of the door sensor is based on the price list for Boxeo.

**Customizing a pricing plan**


The default pricing plan is fixed, to preserve the default pricing logic. You can copy the
default plan, and add or change steps as needed for your organization. When you finish your
changes, you publish the copy so that it becomes the active plan. If needed, you can revert
to the default plan at any time by publishing the default plan.


As a pricing admin or manager, follow these steps to define a custom pricing plan:


**•** Create a configurable pricing plan (copy the default plan).


**•** Add or change a pricing plan step. In your configurable pricing plan, you can add one or

more pricing steps for pricing adjustments, including any conditions for running the step.
You can also change the sequence of the adjustment steps, if needed.


**•** Delete a pricing plan step, if needed.


As you add or change pricing steps, the system validates your entries, such as the sequence
number, price point, and calculation type. When you finish adding or changing steps, publish
the configurable pricing plan to make it active. The former active plan is retired.


**Create a configurable pricing plan**

**Subscription revenue metrics**


Subscription pricing is a pricing model where customers pay a recurring fee for products
or services, usually at regular intervals such as monthly or annually. In Sales and Order
Management, various subscription revenue amounts are calculated automatically for
opportunities and quotes.


Subscription revenue amounts are metrics that help sales agents and sales managers track
and analyze the revenue impact of sales deals. Sales agents and managers can view these
system-calculated revenue amounts in the pricing details for opportunities and quotes, both
at the header and line levels. These revenue amounts, such as monthly recurring revenue
(MRR) or annual recurring revenue (ARR), are useful for monitoring sales performance,
forecasting subscription revenue, and providing relevant subscription amounts when agents
engage with customers.

**Example opportunity subscription revenue details**

**Subscription pricing metrics**


In subscription pricing, common metrics for assessing subscription-based revenue include the
following values and items:


Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)


The total revenue generated from recurring subscriptions or contracts on a
monthly basis. It helps sales agents and managers assess the stability and growth
of subscription-based revenue streams.


Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)


The annual revenue generated from recurring subscriptions or contracts. It
provides insights into the predictable revenue stream that can be expected
from existing customers over a year.


Annual Contract Value (ACV)


The total value of a contract on an annual basis. It highlights the annual revenue
impact of a deal and facilitates comparison with other contracts or revenue
streams.


Total Contract Value (TCV)


The total value of a contract over its entire duration, including recurring and
one-time charges. It provides visibility into the overall value of a deal and its
impact on the organization's financial performance.


Term


The duration or period of a subscription or contract, in months, such as 10 months
or 24 months. In Opportunity Management, agents can enter a Term value
before adding line items. In Quote Management, when agents enter a Term
value and the contract start date, the system uses the term value and start date
to auto-calculate the contract end date. If an agent changes the contract end
date, the system recalculates the Term value.


For products with monthly periodicity, the per-day price (pro-rate multiplier) is
based on the Unit list price/number of days in the month. For a product with
annual periodicity, the per-day price (prp-rate multiplier) that is multiplied

against the decimal fields is the Unit price/365 days or 366 days if the year is a
leap year.


**How subscription pricing revenues are calculated**


Product offers for products and services contain basic pricing information, such as list price
and pricing method (either one-time or recurring periodicity). When agents add product
lines to opportunities and quotes, the system uses basic pricing information and product
line details to auto-calculate the various revenue subscription values. These values are
calculated and displayed in both the header pricing details and line pricing details.


For example, when an agent adds an opportunity line, the system calculates the Cumulative
Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) amount using the unit net price and quantity of the
product. The system then sums up the cumulative revenue to the parent line in the
opportunity and displays the cumulative MRR in the pricing details of the opportunity header.


When agents use the configuration UI to add customizable products to quotes, the
configurator interface displays the calculated subtotal values such as the Cumulative
Monthly Recurring price for the root product offer of the line item.


The following tables describe the subscription pricing revenue amounts for opportunities and
quotes and how they're calculated.


**Opportunity line subscription revenue metrics**

**Create a matrix version**


Create a version of a published price or product eligibility matrix when you need to update
the matrix, for example to add or delete a context variable used in the price matrix.


**Before you begin**
Role required: sn_csm_pricing_pricelist_administrator, sn_csm_pricing_pricelist_manager


**About this task**
You can create a version of a published pricing matrix (Standard Price Adjustment Matrix,
Price List Defaulting Matrix, Cost Book Defaulting Matrix, or Configuration Component Price
Adjustment Matrix) and a product eligibility matrix. When you create a matrix version, the
new version becomes the active version. After creating the version, you update the decision
table for the matrix, then save and publish the matrix.


**Procedure**


**1.** In the CSM Configurable Workspace, select the **List** view.


**2.** Navigate to **Pricing**     - **Pricing Matrices** .


**3.** In the Pricing Matrices list, select the matrix to be updated.


**4.** In the Details tab for the matrix, select **Create new version** .

The following changes occur:


**◦** The new version of the matrix opens in another tab.


**◦** In the former matrix, the **State** changes from Published to Retired and the System **System**

**defined** value changes to false.


**5.** Change the matrix as needed.

For example, if you're updating context variables used in the Standard Price Adjustment
Matrix, you can add or delete context variables in the **Context variables** section of the
matrix.


**6.** Select **Save** .


**7.** Update the decision table for the matrix by selecting **Create rule** .

Add the decision rows in the decision table for the matrix. You can use the decision table

**Create a custom context variable**


Create custom context variables to represent product or non-product characteristics that
can be used by pricing admins to apply control different pricing features, such as pricing
adjustments, or product catalog admins to set product offering eligibility rules.


**Before you begin**
Before creating a custom variable, review the context variables available in the Context
Variables [sn_csm_ctxrul_mgt_context_variable] table to verify whether you need a new
one. This table identifies the system-defined variables provided with Product Catalog
Management and Pricing Management and also any custom variables that have been
created.


For example, the system-defined context variables provided for non-product attributes
include: Account, Shipping Country, Shipping City, Shipping State, Shipping Zip, Billing
Country, Billing City, Billing State, Billing Zip, and Transaction Date.


Role required: admin


**About this task**
As an administrator, you can create custom context variables for items such as nonproduct characteristics, that your pricing and product catalog administrators can use in rule
matrices to control pricing features or product offering eligibility. For example, your pricing
administrator might want to define pricing adjustments based on sales segment, but sales
segment isn’t a system-defined context variable.


You create the variable name and define the variable type, so that the variable can be
used in a decision rule for a rule matrix. After you create the variable, you must also map
the context variable to the transaction entity, such as quote or order, from which the system
retrieves the context.


**Procedure**


**1.** In the CSM Configurable Workspace, select the **List** view.


**2.** Navigate to **Context Rule Management**     - **Context Variables** .

**Exporting and importing pricing entities**


As a pricing admin, you can both export and import pricing entities between ServiceNow
instances. For example, you can promote pricing entities such as price lists from a nonproduction instance to a target production instance. Each process involves a separate set of
steps.


**Before exporting and importing pricing entities**


Before you export your pricing entities to a target instance, note the following prerequisites:


Import product-related entities to your target instance


Verify that your product catalog admin has first imported the product catalog
base entities, product offering catalog, and product offerings to your target
instance. Your pricing entities are associated with product offerings and
catalogs, so the offering and catalog information must exist before you import
pricing entities. For more information on the product entities that must be
imported to your target instance, see Exporting and importing product catalog
entities.


Export the update set for decision table changes to your target instance before
exporting the associated pricing matrix

If you have a new version of a pricing matrix that has decision table changes,
such as a reference to a new product offering, ask your admin to export the
system-generated update set that includes the decision table changes to your
target instance. Next, you export the new pricing matrix, then import the pricing
matrix to your target instance. For more information, see Export pricing entities
and Import pricing entities.

**◦** Product catalog admins are generating or updating blueprints for configurable products.


**◦** Agents are adding configurable products to opportunities, quotes, orders, sold products,

or contracts.


**◦** Customers are using the Business Portal for self-service features requiring configurable

product selections.

#### **Setting up the product configurator**


Control the product options displayed in the product configurator interface by using the
Open State Management API framework.


**Configuration overview**
As an admin, you can manage the configuration states and configurator nodes displayed
in the product configurator by using the Open State Management API framework and open
state management extension points.


**Open state management**


The open state model is a programmatic framework in the Configuration State Model API,
which lets you program variations in product options that appear in the product configurator
in Sales and Order Management. The API framework provides certain states and helper API
methods for controlling how nodes in the product configurator user interface are displayed.


As developers, you can use extension points for open state management to set the viewonly or editable states on any configurator node, based on events that occur at loading or
when product selections change. You can also optionally script information messages along
with changing the state of the node. These messages display contextually in the product
configurator user interface. Various helper API methods are available for reading and setting
states on any node, eliminating the need for extensive JSON scripting.


**Note:** Check your entitlements to determine if you have access to these features.


**Use cases for configuration state management**


The following table shows different ways that you can control the product options displayed
in the product configurator.


**Configuration state model use case examples**







|Product configurator use case|Example|
|---|---|
|Hide certain options for a customer|A product attribute selection isn’t displayed<br>for customers in California due to state safety<br>regulations.|
|Set certain default options for a customer|For upgrades, only the Ultimate plan is<br>displayed for existing customers who have a<br>premium plan.|
|Allow only certain options to be selected<br>based on other attribute options|For certain products such as laptops, display<br>all sizes 13", 15", and 17", but display only<br>15" and 17" laptops if only the touchscreen<br>feature is required.|
|Allow quantity to be set for products|Some products might have different default<br>quantity values. Allow agents to configure<br>the quantity as long as the value is within the|

**Configuration state model use case examples (continued)**






|Product configurator use case|Example|
|---|---|
||~~bounds of a minimum quantity and maximum~~<br>quantity allowed for that product.|
|Allow only certain characteristic selections<br>to be made|Certain product selections require a<br>particular characteristic value to be chosen.<br>For example, upon selection of the Ultimate<br>Internet Plan, the connectivity speed that<br>can be chosen is 5G.|



You can manage the display of options in the product configurator by using the
Configuration State Model API Framework.


**Node states**


Nodes in the product configurator display product relationship groups, child products, and
characteristic options. Nodes can have the following states:


Visible - Yes (make node visible) or No (make node invisible)


Configurations that are visible or not visible to the agent in the product
configurator. Options might not be visible if they're incompatible with other
selections made by the agent. For example, for a particular car wheel size,
incompatible tire options are not visible.


Editable - Yes (show node and make it selectable) or No (show node but make it
unselectable)


Configurations that are editable or not editable by the agent in the product
configurator. Agents can personalize certain aspects of the product while
maintaining constraints that are necessary for the product. For example, for a
specific car model, only compatible exterior colors are editable.


Quantity - Visible (Yes/No), Editable (Yes/No)


Configurations that set quantity on a product, enforce rules related to
quantity, and show informational and error messages related to quantity at the
appropriate node.


Checked - Yes (show node selections) or No (make node selections invisible)


Configurations that show the configuration options for selection based on the
context.


Value - Visible (Yes/No), Editable (Yes/No)


Configurations that set a value for a characteristic, enforce rules related to
the characteristic, and show informational or error messages related at the
appropriate node.


**Note:** Agents can choose to set messages at a node level to provide justification for a
state change.


**Events**


Manage node states using the Configuration State Model API Framework. Activate these
states by using the following two events in the Events Framework of the Configuration State
Model:

**•** On Load - The state (visibility, editability) of each node is initially set to Yes (true). The open

state is invoked on loading.


**•** On Change - This function is called whenever there’s a change in a node's value in the

product configurator user interface. However, this state isn’t invoked when quantity
changes occur in the product configurator. These states can be set programmatically
in one of the following ways: on-load, during selections, or just before the instance is
synchronized back to the transaction


**Helper API methods**


You can use the following helper API methods to read and set states on any node.


Apply states


Set the visible and editable states for product relationship groups, product
characteristics, and product characteristic options using Getter and Setter
methods to read and change the state of the configuration model.


Getter methods


Obtain node paths along with the states on any configuration node:


**•** _`getAllNodes()`_ : Returns JSON with node path (reference to code) and its

respective relative path with all the states.


**•** _`getNode(nodePath)`_ : Returns javascript object of the node for the specified

node path if it exists.


**•** _`getNodeDetails(nodePath`_ : Return all the states for the specified node path if

it exists.


Setter methods


**•** Set the visible and editable states for product relationship groups, product

characteristics, and product characteristic options.


**◦** _`setVisible`_ : True/False at all levels


**◦** _`setVisible(True/False)`_


**◦** _`setEditable`_ : True/False at all levels


**◦** _`setEditable(True)`_


**◦** Implementation example:



![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-142-0.png)




**•** Set the quantity for offers and specifications. The nodePath determines the

product, and the value is the quantity to be set.


**◦** _`setQuantity(nodePath, value);`_


**◦** Implementation example:

**◦** Implementation example:



![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-143-1.png)



Getter context variable methods


Retrieve context variables inside the product configurator user interface.


**•** _`getHeaderContextVariables()`_ : Returns a list of all the header context

variables.


**•** _`getHeaderContextVariableValue(contextVariable)`_ : Returns a value and

the display value of a specific context variable in the header.


**•** _`getLineContextVariables()`_ : Returns a list of all the line context variables.


**•** _`getLineContextVariableValue(nodePath, contextVariable)`_ : Returns

the value of a specific context variable in the line.


**Use extension points for open state management**


Control the options displayed in the product configurator by using extension points in Open
state management.


You can use extension points to call custom scripts for managing the product configurator.


As an admin, access the available open state management extension points, by navigating
to **All**     - **Scripted Extension Points** and in the Extension Points list, select the appropriate
extension point to view it.


**State management extension points**

|Extension points|Description|

**Revise existing opportunities after an upgrade**


Run a scheduled job to modify older opportunities so they can support parent-child
opportunity line items.


**Before you begin**
Role required: admin


**About this task**
The scheduled job helps update opportunity lines on the opportunities created on or before
the Yokohama Q1 release. From Yokohama Q2 release onward, the opportunity lines follow
a hierarchical parent-child structure. The hierarchy is achieved by adding new fields on an
opportunity line and affects the pricing functionality. For the existing lines to incorporate
the updated pricing functionality, the newly added fields must be populated and the
hierarchical structure must be in place.


**Procedure**


**1.** Navigate to **All**     - **System Definition**     - **Scheduled Jobs** .


**2.** On the scheduled job menu, search for the **Revise existing Opportunities on upgrade** job.


**3.** Open the job and select **Execute Now** .


**4.** Navigate to **All**     - **System Logs**     - **System Log**     - **All** .


**5.** Confirm that the job has been completed by checking for the `Opportunity Upgrade Job`


`completed` message.
The log lists the total number of records processed, along with their success and failure
count.


**Note:** If the job is abruptly stopped, the log displays `Opportunity Upgrade Job`
`encountered errors` in addition to the error message.


**Result**
The scheduled job updates the open opportunities (not in any of the closed stages). The job
works differently for opportunities that are synced to Quote than the ones that aren't.


**Example:**
For open, non-synced opportunities:


**1.** The scheduled job updates the newly added **Top Opportunity Line Item** and **Product**

**Specification** fields for all the opportunity lines.


**2.** If a complex product offering has a child offering, the job creates child opportunity lines

under the parent line. Newly created child lines contain correct values populated for the
newly added fields.


**3.** A subsequent pricing call is made to populate pricing fields for all the lines in the hierarchy.


For open, synced opportunities:

**1.** A scheduled job updates the newly added **Top Opportunity Line Item** field for all the

opportunity lines.


**2.** The **Product Specification** field, new hierarchy, and pricing fields for this line are updated

only if any change is done on the corresponding synced quote line.


**Note:** After upgrading to the Yokohama Q2 release, run the scheduled job before
working with Opportunity. Failure to do so results in inconsistent behavior in Opportunity
and the related tables.

#### **Configure Sales Forecasting**

**Setting up jeopardy management**


Learn about how to set up and configure Jeopardy Management for Order Management
for Telecommunications.


During design time, fulfillment managers must complete the following Jeopardy
Management configuration and setup steps:


**•** Define Fulfillment Subflows: Creates an Orchestration plan for each specification. Fulfillment

managers can use demo data flow actions to ensure that order task relationships are
created.


**•** Define Service Level Agreements (SLA) Definitions: SLA definitions track how much time

each order task takes to complete.


**•** Build Decision Tables: Build decision tables that contain information including order task

duration, jeopardy level assignment, and jeopardy enablement.


**Define Fulfillment Subflows**


To use Jeopardy Management, fulfillment managers must either reconfigure existing
fulfillment subflows or create subflows for each specification.


**•** Order tasks are created up front: Subflows that are configured for jeopardy management

create order tasks up front and in a Draft state.


**•** Use Create Order Planned Task flow action: In Decision Builder, use the Create New Order


tasks.


**•** Create task relationships: After all the order tasks are created, fulfillment managers create

order task relationships.


**•** Define fulfillment progress: After all order tasks and task relationships are created, define

the fulfillment progress.


**Create SLA Definitions**


SLA definitions and SLA Processing flows are linked to tasks in a fulfillment plan and track and
report on the time jeopardy-enabled tasks take to complete. See for more information.


**•** SLA Definitions: Set start condition, pause condition, cancel condition, and reset conditions

according to use case.


**•** SLA Durations: Durations are specified so that tracking can be achieved when task SLA is

created.


**•** SLA Processing flow should be defined: Customer can use demo data flows, which trigger

jeopardy level calculation for order tasks at 50%, 75%, 100% task SLA progression.


**Link Jeopardy Management to Product and Service Specifications using**
**Decision Builder**


Decision tables are used to link and configure Jeopardy Management to product and
service specifications in Order Management for Telecommunications.


**•** Order Line Item Jeopardy Level Calculation: Returns Jeopardy Level for order line item

based on delayed percentage of tasks.


**•** Order Task Jeopardy Level Calculation: Sets a task's jeopardy level based on percentage

task completion.


**•** Order Task Duration Assignment Policy: Defines the order duration and task SLA definition.


**•** Order Jeopardy Enablement Policy: Defines if a specification has jeopardy enabled.

**Jeopardy Management use cases**


Jeopardy Management use cases help you explore and understand how Jeopardy
Management works in different scenarios in Order Management for Telecommunications.


**Design-time use cases**


Design-time use cases explain some of the scenarios around configuring and setting up
Jeopardy Management for Order Management for Telecommunications.


**Use case: Configure business logic and workflows**


System admins want to configure and define fulfillment subflows with Jeopardy Management
actions and logic.


Define jeopardy logic using Workflow Studio to links product specifications and a fulfillment
workflow.


**•** Create planned order tasks in Draft state.


**•** Set task relationships.


**•** Create placeholder for domain orders.


**•** Create relationships for order tasks in a domain order.


**•** Set order task state.


**•** Configure jeopardy decision tables.


**Run-time use cases**


Run-time use cases explain some of the scenarios around running and monitoring Jeopardy
Management for Order Management for Telecommunications.


**Use Case: Support predictive jeopardy that monitors customer orders**


Fulfillment agents and managers use jeopardy management workflows to monitor the
potential risk of an order missing a customer due date.


**•** Calculate planned task completion dates and estimated dates.


**•** Monitor order tasks against service level agreements (SLA)s.


**•** Trigger SLA thresholds for order task and order line items.


**•** Update jeopardy levels as needed in the order entry forms.


**•** Roll up planned dates for order tasks that complete.


**Use Case: Support staggered order decomposition and** _`Jeopardy Management`_


Fulfillment managers and agents expect that when a staggered order decomposition
occurs, each occurrence of a staggered order line item causes the Jeopardy Management
workflow logic to restart.


**•** Completed decomposed order line items, the Jeopardy Management workflow restarts

when additional planned tasks are added.


**•** New planned tasks get a task SLA assigned, which is benchmarked for all tasks repeated,

and includes the date roll ups.


**Use Case: Support inflight orders and** _`Jeopardy Management`_

**•** Dates are benchmarked .


**•** Date roll up logic run and reflects the new start and end dates for planned and estimated

dates.


**Configuring Fallout Management**


As a provider, you can use Fallout Management to identify, investigate, and resolve order
processing issues so that orders can continue processing through to completion.


The fallout type is a category that indicates the type of fallout activity. Billing Issue, Inventory
Allocation Failure, and Provisioning Failure fallout types are standard in the ServiceNow AI
Platform. You can define additional ones, according to the requirements of your enterprise.
To learn more about managing order task fallout, see Managing order fallout.


**Create additional fallout types**


Define your own enterprise-specific fallout types to identify, resolve, and investigate order
processing issues so that they can continue processing through to completion.


**Before you begin**
Role required: admin


**About this task**
The fallout type is a category that indicates the type of fallout activity. Billing Issue, Inventory
Allocation Failure, and Provisioning Failure fallout types are standard in the ServiceNow AI
Platform. You can define additional ones, as per the requirements of your enterprise. To learn
more about managing order task fallout, see Managing order fallout.

**Configuring compatibility rules for horizontal relationships**


As a provider, you can use compatibility rules to establish horizontal relationships between
the specifications of multiple products, services, or resources.


You use a compatibility rule to define a source specification and a target specification and
to establish a relationship between them.


The ServiceNow AI Platform provides two types of relationships that you can use to define a
compatibility rule:


**1.** Requires: The source specification requires the defined target specification.


**2.** Excludes: The source specification excludes the defined target specification.

While you're creating a compatibility rule, you can establish the horizontal relationship either
by defining the specifications or by defining the details for the specification characteristics.
You can also define the maximum and minimum quantity of the specifications to support
and fulfill your customer orders as per the defined decomposition rules.


Before you can capture a new customer order that has a horizontal relationship, you must
configure the compatibility rules by defining the source and target specifications. To learn

**Asynchronous order processing for large customer and consumer orders**


If you're an administrator for a communications service provider (CSP), you can support
a high volume of enterprise, multi-site customer orders and consumer orders by using
asynchronous order processing in the ServiceNow [® ] Order Management application.


**Overview of asynchronous order processing**


CSPs support both enterprise customers and consumers. Usually, the orders from enterprise
customers are large multi-site orders and the orders from consumers are high volume.
Asynchronous order processing help you to create bulk or high-volume orders without waiting
for each order to be processed immediately, improving efficiency and system performance.


If you have a Telecommunications Service Management subscription, you can use the
Product Order Open API to receive an order in the Order Management application. Order
processing goes through three stages:


**•** Order validation


**•** Order ingestion


**•** Order creation


**How synchronous order processing works**


With synchronous order processing, an order is received in the Order Management
application through the API. Then, the order records are simultaneously created in a
customer order table after the order validation.


As an administrator, you can activate or deactivate the order validation for synchronous
order processing by setting the _`create_product_order_validation_sync`_ and
_`create_service_order_validation_sync`_ system properties to True (Default) or False in
the ServiceNow AI Platform. Synchronous order processing takes longer than asynchronous
order processing when it comes to creating a large number of customer order records.


**How asynchronous order processing works**


In asynchronous order processing, a high volume of orders or a large number of order
payloads are received through the Product Order Open API (Scripted Rest End Point) in
the Order Management application from the external Configure, Price, and Quote (CPQ)
systems. The order details are first validated and are then inserted into the Inbound Queue

[sn_tmt_core_inbound_queue] table. If there are any validation errors, an error message is
returned in the response.


This validation is managed by the _`create_product_order_validation_async`_ system
property for product orders and the _`create_service_order_validation_async`_
system property for service orders. These properties control the validation in the

asynchronous processing of orders before the orders are inserted into the Inbound Queue

[sn_tmt_core_inbound_queue] table. The default value is set to True.


When the order details are successfully validated, a scheduled job runs to pick up the
records from the Inbound Queue [sn_tmt_core_inbound_queue] table and then creates
entries in the customer order table as shown in the following diagram.


**Asynchronous order processing workflow**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-182-0.png)


The asynchronous order processing follows these steps:


**1.** You must activate the Product Order Open API. The new parameter mode enables the API

to process the orders synchronously or asynchronously. For more information about the API,
[see Product Order Open API](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=tmf622_product_ordering-api&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-api-reference) .


**2.** After you receive a high volume of orders or a large number of the order payloads through

the Product Order Open API in the async mode, the order details are first validated. The
order details include the product offering, order line items, order specifications, order line
items characteristics, and the specification relationship of order line items.


**3.** After the validation of the order details is complete, an entry for each order with a unique

record ID is created in the Inbound Queue [sn_tmt_core_inbound_queue] table. The
following diagram shows how the inbound queue state model works.

table, a scheduled job runs to create the customer orders for the records in the New state.

#### **Configuring agent tools in Sales and Order Management**


The applications in Sales and Order Management share common features and tools for
agents.


This section describes common features that you can configure for your agents, such as
location-based transactions.


**Configuring location-based product transactions**


In Sales and Order Management, agents can create opportunities, quotes, and orders
tailored to customer location. These transactions are called location-based product
transactions.


When the product offerings and services available to customers vary based on location, your
agents can use a location filter in the product catalog UI to select a service location and
view only the products and services appropriate for that location. Agents can then add the

appropriate products to an opportunity, quote, or order. Agents can also copy products and
services from one location to another within the same transaction, which eliminates the need
to create another opportunity, quote, or order for each location.


**Location filter in the product catalog UI and service location in the line item view**
**for quotes**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-184-0.png)


**How location-based transactions work**


Admin and product catalog admin configuration


Admins activate location-based transactions by enabling the
_`sn_sales_common.enable_location_based_transactions`_ system property.


Product catalog admins use the product eligibility rule entity filters to identify
eligible and ineligible product entities (catalogs, categories, and product
offerings). They also set up decision rules in product eligibility matrices, to specify
the context variables, such as billing state or the service location variables
(introduced in the November 2024 release), for controlling the display of eligible
catalogs, categories, or product offerings.

**Rule entity filters and product eligibility rule matrices**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-185-0.png)


In the following example of the Product Offering Catalog Eligibility matrix, a rule
entity filter for ineligible catalogs and the context variable, service state, are
used to filter the product catalog displayed.


**Example product offering catalog eligibility matrix**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-185-1.png)


Agent experience for location-based transactions


When agents specify a service location, the product catalog UI displays the
eligible catalog, categories, or offerings for that location, depending on the
product eligibility entities configured. When they select a simple or fixed product,
the line item is created automatically for the specified location. If they select
a configurable product, they use the product configurator to customize the
product options. A line item is created automatically when they save the
product configuration.


Your agents can then copy line items to another location in the same
transaction (opportunity, quote, or order). They can indicate that only eligible
line items be copied to the specified location.

**Example order line item copy**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-186-0.png)


For details on how agents add products to an opportunity, quote, or order by
location, see the following:


**•** Use location filter to add opportunity line items.


**•** Copy opportunity line items to a location.


**•** Filter catalogs by location in a quote.


**•** Copy locations for quote line items.


**•** Filter product catalog by location.

**Setting up location-based transactions**


Admins and product catalog admins complete the following configuration tasks to set up
location-based transactions.


**Location-based transaction configuration tasks**

**Activate location-based transactions**


Turn on location-based transactions for opportunities, quotes, and orders by using the
_`sn_sales_common.enable_location_based_transactions`_ system property.


**Before you begin**
Role required: admin


**About this task**
The _`sn_sales_common.enable_location_based_transactions`_ system property enables
your agents to select a customer location and view only the eligible products for that
customer location when adding product lines to an opportunity, quote, or order. This feature
also enables agents to copy line items to another location within the same transaction
(opportunity, quote, or order).


**Procedure**


**1.** Navigate to **All** and in the filter enter `sys_properties.list` .


**2.** Open the _`sn_sales_common.enable_location_based_transactions`_ system property.


**3.** In the **Value** field, enter `true` .


**4.** Select **Update** .

The location filter is displayed in the product catalog interface. Agents can use the filter
to select a location when adding product lines to an opportunity, quote, or order. The
catalog displays the eligible product offerings for the location. After adding products from
the catalog, agents can then copy selected products (line items) to another location
within the same transaction, without having to create another opportunity, quote, or order
for a different customer location.


**What to do next**
Define the product eligibility rule filters and matrices that control the product offerings
displayed by location.

#### **Configure Customer Contracts and Entitlements**


Use the Customer Contracts and Entitlements application to configure and display customer
service contracts and entitlements.

**Configuring Contracts and Entitlement Workflows**


Configure the Contracts and Entitlement Workflows plugin (com.sn_contract_ent_wf) to
generate and modify contracts using order management.


As an admin, you can activate the Contracts and Entitlement Workflows plugin
[(com.sn_contract_ent_wf). For more information, see Activate a plugin](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=t_ActivateAPlugin&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-platform-administration) .


The following plugins are prerequisites for activating the Contracts and Entitlement Workflows

Other company names, product names, and logos may be trademarks of the respective companies with which they are associated.


**Creating contracts and entitlements using workflows**


After a product offer is selected by the customer and the product is sold to the customer, this
workflow creates contracts and entitlements based on the services associated with that sold

product and the extra services that the customer has purchased.


There are the product offering scenarios and their configurations.


**Offering types and workflows**






|Offering<br>types|Description|
|---|---|
|Offers for<br>entitlements|The workflow creates entitlement records for such offerings. These<br>entitlements can be associated with existing sold products, install base items,<br>product inventory records, or the customer.|
|Offers for<br>services<br>(contract<br>lines)|The workflow enables automatic creation of a service contract, service<br>contract lines, and the entitlements for those contract lines.|
|Implicit<br>offerings|Implicit entitlements and service contract lines are not shown on order<br>lines. These offers can be marked as implicit when they do not need to<br>be configured while capturing the order and are available as part of a<br>package. These entitlements and service contract lines are automatically<br>created as a part of this workflow.|



**Creating a contract from an order**


For every order with multiple product offerings, a single contract with multiple contract lines
is created. You can add multiple product offerings from an order to an existing contract. To
add a product offering to an existing contract, add the contract reference in the **Existing**
**Contract** field of the order line item. As part of the order processing, a sold product is
generated for every order line.


**Creating contracts from product inventory records**


If the system property sn_ind_tmt_orm.enable_prod_invt_for_order_management is set
to true, order fulfillment workflows create product inventories based on customer orders,
product offerings and specifications. On creation of a product inventory, contract lines and
entitlements will be created. When a product inventory undergoes a state change, the
[associated contract lines and entitlements are synced. For more information, see Product](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=product_inventory_configurations&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-customer-service-management)
[inventory configurations](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=product_inventory_configurations&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-customer-service-management) . Product inventory records trigger updates to contracts and
entitlements under the following conditions:


**•** Process Telecom Order Line flow: The ADD flow creates contract and entitlement records


from the product inventory. The MODIFY flow updates the states of the contract line items
and entitlements.


**•** Post Process Telecom Top Domain Order flow: The MODIFY flow updates the states, fields,

**Roles and components of Partner Relationship Management**


The Partner Relationship Management application uses roles to provide access to
information, identify internal and external users, maintain data security, and establish
different types of relationships between enterprises and channel partners.


The PRM plugin (com.snc.partner_relationship_management) comes with a set of functional
and granular roles, each with varying levels of access to raise and address queries.


The PRM application provides access and permissions to users part of both the enterprise and
the channel partner ecosystem.


**Functional and granular roles**


Functional roles help provide authorized related parties access to enterprise and channel
partner members. A granular model helps to protect data by granting the required level of
access to the relevant enterprise or channel partner entities. With this functionality, each role
is associated with a set of privileges or responsibilities that determine users’ access to certain
information.


You can set granular policies that authorize individuals to do their jobs efficiently and
effectively, which helps to improve the customer experience.


**Roles and descriptions**


Functional roles are a set of granular roles that are required to perform a function that
requires access to multiple entities. The following table lists the functional roles for Partner

products to opportunities, quotes, and orders, manage sold products and product inventory,
and work on MACD orders.

#### **Using product catalogs**

quote, or order, a Catalog tab (related list) opens, which provides a visual display of the
product offerings available in a catalog.


You can add simple products and if available, complex products that can be further
customized. When you start a lead, the Catalog tab displays simple products that can be
added and don't require further customization.


**Product catalog interface**

#### **Using ServiceNow CPQ**

products in Sales and Order Management transactions such as opportunities, quotes, and
orders.


**CPQ Configurator overview**


With the CPQ Configurator, agents and customers can configure offerings dynamically
based on customer needs or product attributes, without having extensive knowledge of
product structures and hierarchies. Agents use the configurator in the CSM Configurable
Workspace, while customers use the configurator in the Business Portal for self-service
transactions.


**Note:** The CPQ Configurator is available if ServiceNow CPQ has been implemented
in your organization. Contact your ServiceNow account representative to obtain
ServiceNow CPQ.

**• Product hierarchy** : Lists the parent and child product relationships for configurable

products.


**• Option selection** : Displays the product options that can be selected, for example product

characteristics such as color or model.

**•** Clone a child offering or split a child offering that has a quantity greater than 1.


**◦** The **Clone** option copies the child offering based on the number of copies that you

specify and creates identical offering configurations.


**◦** The **Split** option divides the current child offering quantity by the number of splits that you

specify and distributes the quantity evenly across all the copies.


**•** Customize the options and characteristics for each child offering instance created.


**•** Delete a child offering instance, as long as the minimum number of child offerings defined

for the product is maintained.


**Note:** Even when the multiple configurations feature is enabled, there are scenarios
in which some configuration options might not be available. The system uses the
default, minimum, and maximum quantity values from the product definition to
determine valid configurations and then enables or disables the **Split** or **Delete** options
for managing child offering configurations. For more information on validation, see
Multiple configurations.


**Procedure**


**1.** In the CSM Configurable Workspace, select the **List** view.

#### **Using Sales Forecasting**


Sales Forecasting uses the current opportunities in the system to predict future opportunity
amounts. The Opportunity Management application contains the list of opportunities
created for the customers and each of these opportunities are in different stages of the sales
cycles.


Once an opportunity is created, the Forecast Category field displays Pipeline by default.
The sales agent working on that opportunity updates this field once the sales process starts.
When the agents update the forecast category, the dashboard keeps displaying the latest
data. The forecast scheduler keeps updating the data on the Sales Forecast dashboard.
After the users, groups and opportunity data are added, along with selection of category,
select Update Forecast on Sales Forecast dashboard to view the latest forecast information.


**Viewing the Sales Forecast dashboard**


You can view the Sales Forecast dashboard to see the current sales status and targets
achieved for your teams. Only Forecast Admin, Forecast Analyst, and the owner of the
highest group can see the data and sales forecast for all the groups and the team. Other
personas can only view the sales forecast and related information for their own hierarchy or
for the hierarchies below them.


**Using the Sales Forecast dashboard**


To access the Sales Forecast dashboard, navigate to **CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace**


and select the **Sales Forecast** view. Select the refresh icon to see the latest sales forecast

data. Select **Update Forecast** on the dashboard to fetch the data to generate the latest

quota of $7,000 assigned to it. Gap is the difference between the Quota and Won sales. For
Global, the gap is $5,100, meaning they need to achieve an additional $5,100 to meet the
quota. As the owner of this group, Jennifer Harris can track the quota achieved for each
team and specific agent if required.

#### **Using Order Management**


ServiceNow Order Management provides a centralized platform to create and manage
customer and service orders throughout their entire life cycle. It automates the complex
process from order capture and enrichment through to fulfillment and closure, promoting
seamless coordination between sales, operations, and technical teams.


**Overview of the order life cycle**


Access the Order Management capabilities from the CSM/FSM Configurable Workspace to
capture and manage orders. A typical order life cycle is a structured, multiphase process
that guides a customer's request from initial submission to final delivery and fulfillment, as
shown in the following illustration.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-287-5.png)


**1.** Creating orders

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-287-7.png)


The order life cycle begins when a customer's request is submitted. This could be from a
salesperson creating a quote that's then converted to an order, a sales agent directly
capturing an order through the workspace, a customer placing an order online through
the Business Portal, or an order being created via an API from another system. This phase
focuses on getting all the customer-facing details, including what was ordered, pricing,
and customer information, into the system.


**2.** Enriching orders


If order enrichment subflow is configured for a product offering, then order enrichment
tasks are created. The fulfillment agent captures additional details required to fulfill the
order. This phase prevents errors from propagating further into the process. Not all orders
need enrichment.


**3.** Approving or rejecting orders


The fulfillment manager reviews the order, order lines, and pricing details and approves or
rejects the order.

Other company names, product names, and logos may be trademarks of the respective companies with which they are associated.


**4.** [System] Order decomposition


This is a critical step for businesses selling complex products or services. The single, high-level
order is automatically broken down into smaller, actionable service orders or fulfillment
tasks based on how the process admin has configured order decomposition. For example,
a customer's order for a telecom bundle would be decomposed into separate tasks for
IT provisioning, a field technician, and the billing department. This process translates the
customer's request into a detailed operational plan.


View product, service, or resource orders for tracking the fulfillment process, verifying that
all required tasks and suborders are created correctly, and confirming that the order
progresses through its life cycle as expected. For more information, see View domain
orders.


**5.** [System] Order orchestration


The system orchestrates the fulfillment of each individual product, service, and resource
orders. Tasks are automatically created and assigned to the correct teams and systems,
and the application tracks their progress.


Work orders are created if you have an integration with Field Service Management.


**6.** (Optional) Inflight order changes


Inflight order changes come into the picture after an order has been submitted and is
actively being processed, but before it has been completely fulfilled and closed. These
changes are a form of MACD orders (Modify, Adds, Changes, and Deletes) that occur
during the fulfillment life cycle.


**7.** Order fulfillment


Fulfillment agents complete order tasks assigned to them. Fulfillment managers monitor the
fulfillment process and manage issues using features such as Jeopardy Management to
alert teams about potential delays and Fallout Management to handle errors.


As each fulfillment task is completed, the service or product is activated or delivered to the
customer. This can involve anything from a physical delivery to the electronic provisioning
of a digital service. Once all products and services are activated and delivered, the order
is officially closed. The system updates the order status to reflect completion and updates
creates sold product records.


**8.** Managing order fallouts


Manage failures that may take place during order fulfillment due to errors and exceptions.
These exceptions include incorrect data, connectivity problems, inadequate inventory
supply, or other unforeseen issues.


**9.** Monitoring order jeopardy


Proactively monitor and mitigate order delivery delays, dynamically track task progression
to predict potential order fulfillment delays, and alert service delivery teams when
fulfillment plans exceed or are expected to exceed committed completion times by
monitoring the jeopardy status.


**10.** Managing post-fulfillment order changes


Order agents can make the following post-sale changes to the orders after an initial order
has been placed and fulfilled:

**Order types in Sales and Order Management**


Customer orders and service orders are the two main type of sales orders in ServiceNow
Order Management. Learn about their differences and how to select an appropriate order
type for your use case.


Use customer orders for ordering products or services. Use service orders for the activation
of new services or for the post-sales requests for the services that were activated for and
delivered to customers at earlier dates. By using this process, you ensure that service orders
are correct and handled efficiently throughout the entire fulfillment process. The following
table compares customer and service orders and lists the differences between the two.

technical fulfillment.


Use service orders for the activation of new

services or for the post-sales requests for
the services that were activated for and

delivered to customers at earlier dates.

**Differences between the pre- and post-approval service orders**


Like customer orders, captured service orders also have an ID with a prefix of ORD(nnn).
The **Order Category** field in the order forms indicates if the order is for a **Product** (a customer
order) or a **Service** (a service order). These labels enable you to identify the type of order.


When you approve a captured service order for fulfillment, the post-approval decomposition
process generates actionable service orders and resource orders. You may see a single
service order, multiple service orders, and resource orders that are associated with your
approved service order.


**•** Service orders with a prefix of SO(nnn) are referred to as domain orders. These orders, and

their related resource orders, with a prefix of RO(nnn), must be fulfilled to complete the
service order line items on the captured service orders.


**•** The resource order manages the resources required to fulfill the services that the customer

is requesting.


**•** These domain orders manage the fulfillment of the requested service orders.


To learn more, see Order decomposition.


**Action types for customer and service orders**


Learn how you can take various types of actions for your customer orders. Action types
include add, change, disconnect, suspension, resume, or no-change of services.


By using an order action type, you can define the type of actions that you want to do with
an order. The following table lists the order action types.

**Order action types**

|Order action type|Description|
|---|---|
|Add|Add a customer order that isn’t associated with an existing<br>order from the same customer. This customer order results in<br>new order management and fulfillment activities.<br>For example, you place a new order for a home internet<br>service.|
|Change|Change an existing order, which changes a previously<br>ordered or fulfilled product or service. This order action type<br>includes the following scenarios:<br>**•** Addition of a child product specification that the<br>customer didn’t previously order.<br>**•** Deletion of an optional child product specification that<br>the customer already has. For example, you upgrade the<br>download speed of your home internet from 100 Mbps to<br>1000 Mbps.<br>**•** Change characteristics or service location for existing<br>products.<br>**•** As part of the fulfillment workflows, define a PONR (Point<br>of No Return) step for each service or resource order.|
|Disconnect|Disconnect an existing customer service order. For<br>example, you can disconnect your home internet service.|
|Suspend|Product or service order to temporarily inactivate the<br>product inventory of its order line items.|
|Resume|Product or service order to activate the product inventory<br>of its order line items that were previously suspended.|
|No change|Order line items with No change action are included in<br>the order for informational purpose only. For example, an<br>order contains multiple items, but only one of those items<br>must be changed (such as the speed, which has changed<br>from 100 Mbps to 1000 Mbps), which affects the parent line<br>item. However, all the other line items in the order remain<br>unchanged.|



**Note:** The Move action type has been deprecated and can't be used.

**◦** If post-capture order enrichment is configured, enrichment tasks are created, and the

order state changes to Enrichment in progress.


If you're blocked on order enrichment tasks, change the order state to Enrichment on
hold. When you're unblocked, change the order state back to Enrichment in progress.


**◦** If the details captured while creating the order are sufficient to process the order and no

enrichment is required, then the order state changes to New.


**3.** When the order is in the New state, you can either approve or reject the order.

Accordingly, the state changes to either Acknowledged or Rejected.


**4.** The order in the Acknowledged state then undergoes decomposition. Domain orders are

created and fulfillment flows are triggered and the order state changes to In progress.


**5.** If the order is successfully fulfilled, the order state changes to Completed. If there are issues

during order processing, then the outcome depends on how the issue was handled. The
scenarios and their outcomes are listed in the following table.







|Scenario|State|Outcome|
|---|---|---|
|More information<br>needed to process the<br>order|<br>Awaiting<br>information|**◦**If additional information is received, the order<br>state changes to In progress.<br>**◦**Or else, the order state changes to Accessing<br>cancellation.|
|Inflight order change|Revision in<br>progress|**◦**If compensation plan is triggered, then the order<br>state changes back to In progress.<br>**◦**Or else, the order state changes to Accessing<br>cancellation.|

cancellation state change to Canceled.


**Methods of creating orders in Sales and Order Management**


Orders can be created by agents, customers, or using APIs in ServiceNow Order
Management. Irrespective of where or how you create orders, all orders can be managed,
tracked, and fulfilled using Order Management.


**Order capture by the agents**


Order agents and service agents can capture orders for existing customers from the CSM/
FSM Configurable Workspace. Sales agents can create orders by converting an approved
quote. The following table lists the various order creation channels and their benefits.


**Order capture channels for agents**








|Channel|Persona|Benefit|
|---|---|---|
|Converting a quote<br>to an order|Sales<br>agents|The quote-to-order conversion supports post-quote workflows<br>such as order capture, fulfillment, and contract creation.<br>Benefits include:<br>**•** Reduced errors from manual data handling<br>**•** Consistency across systems by using a unified data model<br>**•** Support for complex product configurations and pricing<br>strategies, including bundles and multi-currency pricing|
|Creating orders<br>from Accounts<br>page|Order<br>or<br>service<br>agents|The Accounts Information tab provides a 360-degree view<br>of customer interactions, including quotes, contracts,<br>entitlements, and previous orders. Creating orders from this<br>context promotes:<br>**•** Better-informed decisions based on historical data<br>**•** Fewer errors due to pre-filled fields and validated account<br>details<br>**•** Faster order initiation based on pre-existing account data|
|Creating orders<br>from Customer<br>Orders or Service<br>Orders list view|Order<br>or<br>service<br>agents|Alternate way to create an order for an account or a<br>consumer with a different set of contact information or<br>parameters.|

**Order creation using TM Forum (TMF) APIs**


Most of the service orders that you process are captured from third-party customer order
management systems through the Service Order Open API. The Service Order Open
API is a ServiceNow implementation of the TM Forum TMF641 Service Ordering Open API
[specification. To learn more, see Service Order Open API](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=service-order-open-api&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-api-reference) .


Order creators and order integrators for a Communications Service Provider (CSP) company
can use the following TMF APIs to create orders:


**•** [TMF622: Product Ordering API](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=tmf622_product_ordering-api&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-api-reference)


**•** [TMF641: Service Ordering API](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=service-order-open-api&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-api-reference)


**Note:** You need a Telecommunications Service Management subscription to create
orders using TMF APIs.


**Order creation using Service Exchange**


Your ServiceNow instances can be integrated with the instances of your customers by using
Service Bridge. With this integration, you can create and publish product offerings to your
customer's instances. Enterprise customers can then submit requests for products or services,
which you can then fulfill using Order Management. For detailed benefits on using the
[Service Bridge applications, see Exploring Service Bridge](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=service-bridge-v2-exploring-service-bridge&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-service-bridge) .


**Order creation by B2B customers**


Business-to-Business (B2B) customers can leverage self-service capabilities provided through
the Business Portal to browse products and submit orders. These orders are then processed
by the order and fulfillment agents. For more information, see Create orders from the Business
Portal.


**Post-capture order record generation**


When you capture or directly enter a customer or service order, the corresponding order
record is generated in the ServiceNow AI Platform. The order record has one or more
associated order line items that describe the product or service and the action (Add,
Change, Disconnect) to perform any required service for the item. The order line also
contains the following elements:


**•** The details of the product or service being added, updated, or deleted.


**•** For Add type orders, the order line item holds the details of the product specification, with

its required characteristics and characteristic values.


**•** For Change and Disconnect type orders, the order line holds the details of the product

inventory that you're updating or disconnecting.


**•** The order line item can have a location and related information such as customer


contacts detail.

**Order quantity support**


Learn how you can support and fulfill your customer orders for multiple instances of a product
or service. You can create multiple domain orders that equal the order quantity for each
instance of the product or service. This way, you can efficiently decompose and manage
the fulfillment of your customer orders.


**Overview**


An instance of a product or service refers to an ordered item with a unique set of order
characteristic values, such as the speed and memory size. A customer might order the
same top-level product or service for different locations, but each might differ in their order
characteristics. For example, if a customer orders a router for one of their locations, it might
have a memory size selection that varies from the same router model that was ordered
for another location. Order Management supports this order quantity processing for the
following scenarios:


**Support for the order line item quantity that is provided by the customer when**
**they order an item**


If your customer places an order with more than one instance, the Quantity field on the
order line item captures the number of instances of your customer order line items. The order
decomposition process then creates the same number of product or service orders and
manages the fulfillment process for each order independently.


**Support for the catalog-driven characteristic quantity**


In this scenario, the decomposition process decomposes a product or service order into the
required number of domain orders. These domain orders are based on the quantity mapping
that you define in the product catalog between the source and target specifications that
are used in a product offering. The quantity mapping in the specification relationship triggers
the decomposition process to create the required number of domain orders for the fulfillment

process.

**Support for the characteristic based quantity**


In this scenario, you accept and support your customer order that has the information for
order characteristics value which impacts the quantity of the domain orders. So, the order
decomposition process refers to following information to create the required number of
domain orders.


**•** Specification relationship with quantity characteristic


**•** Characteristic mapping


**Set up and review order lines**


Once products and services are added to an order in Order Management, you can set up

**Price adjustment example**


To understand price adjustment and the terms used, let's consider a scenario where a
customer is purchasing an API Edition license from a provider.


**•** Unit Base Price: The price defined in the Price List, say $1000.


**•** Attribute Adjustment: The customer opts for the "Professional Plus Edition" version of the

product with Price Point as List Price which costs them additional $200.


**•** Volume adjustment: The customer receives a discount of $50 when they purchase 100

licenses. Here as well, the Price Point is the List Price.


**•** Price Point: The Price point is the entity on which the price adjustments were applied. It

could be the List Price or Net Price.


**•** Unit List Price: The Unit List Price is calculated as $1000 + $200 - $50 = $1150.


**•** Customer also receives a premier account discount of $100 with Price Point as Net Price.


**•** Unit Net Price: The Unit Net Price is the final price after all adjustments have been applied.

This is calculated as $1150 - $100 = $1050.

**What to do next**
For complex orders, capture technical details. For more information, see Capture order
enrichment details for complex fulfillment.


If order enrichment tasks don't apply, move to order approval. For more information, see
Approving or rejecting orders.


**Enriching orders in Order Management**


Order enrichment is a post-capture stage in the Order Management life cycle that enables
fulfillment agents to gather additional information from customers for complex orders before
submitting the order for approval.


**Overview of post-capture order enrichment**


The order enrichment process is designed to improve fulfillment accuracy and help prevent
potential delays or fallouts for complex product or service orders. Fulfillment agents collect
additional, context-specific information from customers that is not required during initial
order capture because these details don't affect product selection or pricing. The order
enrichment process helps the order agents to create basic order entries quickly without
needing to wait for technical details that are crucial for fulfillment.


Not all orders require enrichment. For complex offerings such as elevator installations, critical
details like installation location and door configuration may not be available during initial
order placement. Capturing this information later helps the fulfillment agents to have the
necessary data for executing the order efficiently and accurately.


**How the order enrichment process works**


After an order is captured by an order agent, the system checks whether the Order
Enrichment Flow Policy is configured for the product or service in the decision tables. If the
Order Enrichment Flow Policy is configured, enrichment tasks are automatically created
against the order lines that require enrichment and are assigned to the appropriate
fulfillment agent. At this stage, the state of the order and its line items change to Enrichment
in progress. If an order line doesn't qualify for enrichment, it's state changes to New.


Next, the agent then contacts the customer to collect the required details and captures
them using the configurator UI. For example, if a customer orders elevators, the fulfillment
agent must know the following site details before they send out install technicians:


**•** Door configuration (for example, side-opening, center-opening)


**•** Building entrance width


**•** Electrical rating


Only the information necessary for fulfillment is displayed in the configurator UI and stored in
the order record.


The fulfillment agent reviews and closes each task after capturing the required additional
details for order decomposition and fulfillment. When the order enrichment is completed, the
state of the order line items and the parent order changes to New.


The fulfillment agent or manager can now approve or reject the order.

**Benefits**


**•** Improved accuracy: Reduces delays or fallouts caused by incomplete or incorrect data.


**•** Higher conversion rates: Enables customers to place orders quickly without needing all

technical details upfront.


**•** Operational efficiency: Ensures that fulfillment agents have the correct data at hand.


**•** Customer engagement: Builds trust through multi-step collaboration rather than one-time

transactions.


**Configuration requirements**


Order enrichment tasks are only created if the enrichment process is explicitly configured in
the Order Enrichment Flow Policy in the decision tables for a product or service offering. This
process ensures that enrichment is applied selectively and only when necessary. For more
information, see Configure order enrichment flows using Decision Tables.

**What to do next**
Approve orders in Order Management


**Approving or rejecting orders**


Fulfillment managers bridge the gap between order intake and execution by reviewing the
order information and deciding whether an order is ready to proceed or requires further
review.


**Approval workflow**


To begin the approval process, start by reviewing the order and its line items thoroughly.
Verify that all required fields such as order number, customer account details, contact
information, pricing, critical dates, and product or service specifications are complete and
accurate. The order must be in a New state to be eligible for approval.


Next, validate the order against your organization’s approval criteria. The approval criteria
could include checks such as:


**•** Accuracy of order details


**•** Completeness of required fields

**•** Compliance with business rules such as discount thresholds, contractual terms, or inventory

availability


**•** Validity of associated agreements or entitlements


Throughout the process, maintain clear documentation and communication. If any issues
arise, coordinate with relevant teams to resolve them before approval, promoting a smooth
transition from order intake to fulfillment, and minimizing delays or fallout.


You can make corrections or updates to order characteristics before approval. Once
the order passes all checks, proceed to approve it. This action updates the order status
to In progress, which triggers the fulfillment workflows such as decomposition into domain
orders, tasks, assignment to teams, and scheduling. The system logs the approval action and
updates revision fields to reflect the change.


**Rejection workflow**


Begin by carefully reviewing the order details against your organization's rejection criteria
checklist. The following is a list of common rejection triggers:


**•** Missing or incorrect data


**•** Policy violations such as unauthorized discounts or invalid entitlements


**•** Inventory constraints


**•** Fraud or risk flags


Once a rejection decision is made, update the order status to Rejected in the system. This
action automatically halts any associated fulfillment workflows, stopping the order from
being processed further. It’s important to document the reason for rejection clearly using
work notes so that the requester or relevant teams understand what must be corrected.


**Reevaluating rejected orders**


A rejected order can be corrected and resubmitted for reevaluation by the order agent.
If all issues are resolved and the order meets approval criteria, you can approve the order.
Approving a rejected order updates the status back to In progress, enabling fulfillment to

resume.


**Validate the related items of a customer order for its compatibility**


Validate the related order line items of your customer order, which includes the horizontal
specification relationships, to make sure that the order-related information is correctly
generated to fulfill your customer order.


**Before you begin**
A horizontal specification relationship is defined by defining a compatibility rule between the
product, service, or resource specifications in a product catalog.


Role required: order_approver, order_viewer, sn_ind_tmt_orm.order-fulfillment_agent, or
sn_ind_tmt_orm.order_fulfillment_manager


**About this task**
After you define a compatibility rule, when you capture a customer order, you can validate
the order related items before you approve the order. For this validation, you review the
specification relationships of the order line items and the order input data of your customer
when you created the order.


Validations occur at two levels:

**Order decomposition**


Order decomposition is the process of breaking down an approved customer or service
order into a set of smaller, manageable domain orders for fulfillment. This process is driven by
definitions in the product catalog to ensure that all necessary components are provisioned
correctly. Learn about the decomposition process for customer and service order and their
differences.


**Overview of order decomposition**


When an order is approved, the system breaks down the commercial elements of an
approved order into its smaller, actionable technical components called domain orders
(product, service, and resource orders) for fulfillment. Decomposition defines the Bill of
Material for an ordered component. The decomposition is guided by specifications,
specification relationships, and decomposition rules defined in the product catalog.
Decomposition rules (often exclusion rules) determine when domain orders should or
should not be created, based on characteristics or options present in the order line
item. Decomposition establishes hierarchical relationships between source and target
specifications, generating the necessary product, service, and resource orders.


For example, consider the SD-WAN Service Package from the demo data. For this product,
specification relationships and decomposition rules determine which product, service, and
resource orders are generated based on the order's characteristics.


During order decomposition, work orders are created for product or service orders that need
further action. For example, installation of a device at the customer site. You must close the
order tasks and work order tasks associated with the domain orders to proceed with order
fulfillment. Fallout records are created if you manually close the domain orders.


**Hierarchy of domain orders**


The domain order hierarchy is structured as follows:


Product order (Parent)


Defines the commercial intent of what is being sold. It is based on a product
specification that includes brand, pricing, terms, and other product-related
materials. The product order initiates the fulfillment process by triggering
associated service and resource orders.


Service order (Child of product order)


Manages the fulfillment of a specific service specification. It outlines the
technical realization and delivery of the service, often involving multiple service
and resource orders.


Resource order (Child of service order)


Handles the provisioning of physical or logical resources required to deliver
the service. It is based on a resource specification and may include multiple
resource orders depending on the complexity of the service.


Each product order can have multiple service orders, and each service order can have
multiple resource orders, depending on the relationships defined in the product specification.


**The role of specification relationships and decomposition rules**


The following core components drive the decomposition process:

**•** Specifications: Define the attributes of products, services, and resources.


**•** Specification relationships: Define how different specifications are related to each other.


**•** Decomposition rules: Provide conditional logic for the decomposition process.


Decomposition runs on the specification associated with the order line item and its hierarchy.
The type of relationship between specifications determines the outcome.


**•** If the relationship is of type Bundles, Realized as, or Requires, decomposition process

creates the following types of orders for the target specification:


**◦** A corresponding customer-facing service order (CFS), which is a service order that is

generated for performance of customer-faced services.


**◦** A resource-facing service order (RFS), which is a service order that is generated for

internal use of resources required to perform the actual services for the customer.


**◦** Resource order.


**•** If the relationship is of type Composed of, decomposition does not occur for that

relationship.


Decomposition rules function as exclusion rules. They are used to prevent the creation of
certain domain orders if the incoming order does not contain a specific characteristic or
characteristic option. This allows for optional components within a product or service offering.
For example, a rule can be set to only generate a service order for a specific feature if the
customer explicitly selected that feature during the ordering process.


Specification relationships and decomposition rules can be defined to exclude domain
orders when certain characteristics are not present. For example, if a customer or service
order does not include a required characteristic such as Tenancy or WAN Optimization, the
related domain order is not generated.


The decomposition process uses the source specification (defining the relationship) and the
target specification (being defined to), with rules mapped to specific characteristics and
values.


To learn more about the specification relationships and decomposition rules, see product/
tmt-order-mgt/task/order-mgt-specification-rels.dita.


**Customer order vs. Service order decomposition**


While the fundamental principles of decomposition remain the same, there are key
differences when decomposing a service order compared to a customer order. The most
significant difference is that service order decomposition does not generate product orders.
The process is focused exclusively on the fulfillment of services and their underlying resources.
The decomposition of a service order generates a specific set of service and resource orders:


**•** Customer-Facing Service (CFS) Order: A service order for the performance of a customer
facing service.


**•** Resource-Facing Service (RFS) Order: A service order for the internal use of resources

required to perform the actual service for the customer.


The scope of service order decomposition is focused on the logical breakdown of services. It
does not typically involve concepts like staggered or quantity-based decomposition, which
are more common in customer orders that may include physical products with variable
quantities and complex, multi-stage fulfillment cycles. The key differences are listed in the
following table.

**Additional features in customer order decomposition**


Customer order decomposition supports the following additional features:


**•** Staggered decomposition: Customer orders may use staggered decomposition, creating

domain orders at later stages based on updated information such as service availability or
customer needs.


**•** Quantity-based decomposition: Customer orders can be decomposed into multiple

domain orders based on order quantity, supporting revisions, and fulfillment of multiple
instances.


**•** Support for change orders: Customer order decomposition supports updates to quantity

characteristics, enabling upgrades, downgrades, and inventory management during
fulfillment.


Fore more information, see Customer order decomposition.


**Order decomposition examples**


Examples using demo data illustrating how customer and service orders can be
decomposed under diverse conditions help you to understand the decomposition process.
The conditions include optional characteristics, quantity-based decomposition, staggered
fulfillment, and exclusion rules that support complex order management and fulfillment
workflows.


**Specification relationship and decomposition rule example**


The Managed Firewall service demo data is an example of a customer facing service
specification that has a Requires relationship with the following three resource-facing service
specifications:


**•** Firewall Administrator


**•** Firewall and DMZ


**•** Threat and Intrusion Prevention service


As shown in the following example, each resource-facing service specification has
relationships with the corresponding resource specifications that are required for Managed
Firewall service delivery. The decomposition process creates an RFS service order only when
the corresponding characteristic is available in the order line item for the Managed Firewall
service specification.

**Managed Firewall Service structure**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-319-0.png)


After receiving a service order for adding a Managed Firewall service, a service manager
reviews and approves it. This process triggers decomposition, which creates the RFS service
orders and resource orders. The service order has one order line item for the Managed
Firewall service, which includes all of its characteristics. The service order decomposition
process creates the following:


**•** A CFS service order for Managed Firewall service.


**•** Three RFS service orders for all three RFS specifications.


**•** Three resource orders for resource specifications.


The decomposition and fulfillment process is shown in the following diagram:


**Service order decomposition and fulfillment**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-319-1.png)


Next, the ServiceNow AI Platform triggers a fulfillment workflow for the decomposed service
and resource orders. This workflow generates the required order tasks for fulfilling the domain
orders and uses decision tables to identify the workflow for a decomposed order. The
selected workflow is based on various attributes in the original service order. These attributes
include the specification category, and an order line item action (Add, Change, or Delete),
among others.

**Example of an order decomposition that is based on specification relationships**


Specification relationships define the relationships between a product, service, and resource.
When you define specification relationships, you can optionally create decomposition rules
to specify how a customer order is decomposed, fulfilled, and delivered to your customer.


The best way to view a decomposition rule is as an exclusion rule. You use decomposition
rules to specify to exclude domain orders from being created when you receive a customer
order that doesn't contain a characteristic or characteristic option. For example, in the SDWAN Service Package demo data, the following occurs:


**•** A specification relationship is defined between the SD-WAN Controller product

specification and its service specifications.


**•** The service specification details the services that are required for the product. When an

order is received for the SD-WAN Controller product, a product order and a service order
are generated for the SD-WAN Controller Service.


Decomposition runs on the specification that is associated with the customer order line item
and its hierarchy of specifications. It works as follows:


**•** If the relationships between the source and target specifications are Bundles, Realized

as, or Requires types, a product, service, or resource order is created for the target
specification when the customer order is decomposed.


**•** Decomposition establishes the hierarchical relationship between the source and targets

while generating the product, service, and resource orders.


**•** If the specification relationship is of a Composed of type, decomposition doesn't happen.


The SD-WAN Service Package demo data is an example of a composite product
specification that bundles three other product specifications within it:


**•** SD-WAN Controller


**•** SD-WAN Edge Device


**•** SD-WAN Security


The SD-WAN Service Package defines the following relationships:


**•** SD-WAN Service Package has a Bundles relationship with an SD-WAN Controller


**•** SD-WAN Service Package has a Bundles relationship with an SD-WAN Edge Device


**•** SD-WAN Service Package has a Bundles relationship with SD-WAN Security


When a customer order is received for the SD-WAN Service Package, and that order is
approved, decomposition is triggered. The customer order line item for the SD-WAN Service
Package has a single product order for the SD-WAN Service Package. That SD-WAN Service
Package Product order has three child product orders:


**•** SD-WAN Controller


**•** SD-WAN Edge Device


**•** SD-WAN Security (if the option security product was ordered)


**Example of order decomposition that is based on defined decomposition rules**


When you define specification relationships, you can optionally create decomposition
rules. With a decomposition rule, you can specify to exclude domain orders from being

created when you receive a customer order that doesn't contain a specific characteristic
or characteristic option. The following example shows that the SD-WAN Controller Tenancy
product characteristic was designated as optional.


**SD-WAN Controller Tenancy product characteristic**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-321-0.png)


In the example, you see that a decomposition rule was defined for the SD-WAN Controller
product specification relationship to the SD-WAN Controller Service. This rule excludes the
specification when a customer does not select the **Tenancy** option.


**SD-WAN Controller Service decomposition rule**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-321-1.png)


When a customer places an order and doesn't select the **Tenancy** option, the related service
order doesn't generate for it.


**Example of order decomposition that include references to characteristics and**
**options**


You can define the decomposition rules for a specification relationship and include
references to a characteristic and characteristic option. The following elements comprise the
specification relationship:


**•** The source specification is the specification that defines the specification relationship.


**•** The target specification is the specification that the relationship is being defined to.


**•** Both values are automatically defined when you create the decomposition rule from the

specification relationship.

If the characteristic and value are present on the order line, the ServiceNow AI Platform
applies the decomposition rules to Add and Change type orders. They are not applied to
customer order line items with a Disconnect (Delete) order action.


In this example, the SD-WAN Edge Device is a product specification and SD-WAN Security is a
service specification.


**•** The SD-WAN Edge Device has a characteristic called WAN Optimization and has a

Realized as relationship with SD-WAN Security.


**•** There is a decomposition rule for this relationship with WAN Optimization as the

characteristic.


If you receive an order for the SD-WAN Service Package that doesn’t include the WAN
Optimization characteristic, the decomposition rule prevents the generation of an SD-WAN
Controller Service service order. The rule designates that the decomposition of that service
order only happens if that characteristic is ordered.


**Order decomposition for order line-item quantity and order quantity**
**characteristics changes**


When order decomposition process uses the order quantity information from the order
capture process to create multiple product orders that match the line item quantity for a
customer order. An agent then fulfills each instance of the product separately, which create
the inventory records for each of the fulfillment instances.


When a customer submits an order for three instances of the SD-WAN Service Package
product and you approve the order, the decomposition process creates three product
orders for the SD-WAN Service Package including one product order for each order line
item. Each product order in the SD-WAN Service Package creates three child orders for the
products and services for the order fulfillment process.

**Example of staggered decomposition**


The following example describes the staggered decomposition process for a product offering
called SD-WAN Bronze Plan.

**SD-WAN Bronze Plan product offering**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-323-0.png)


The SD-WAN Bronze Plan product offering uses a product specification, called an SD-WAN
Service Package (as shown in the following example), that has three target specifications:


**•** SD-WAN Edge Device


**•** SD-WAN Security


**•** SD-WAN Controller


**SD-WAN Service Package product specifications**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-323-1.png)


The SD-WAN Edge Device product specification has specification relationships with SD WAN
Optimization Service and SD-WAN Routing, and the underlying decomposition rules don't
have any values for WAN Optimization and Routing characteristics.

**SD-WAN Bronze Plan specification relationships**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-324-0.png)


The following example shows the decomposition rules for the product offering for the SDWAN Bronze Plan.


**SD-WAN Bronze Plan decomposition rules**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-324-1.png)


When your customer places an order for the SD-WAN Bronze Plan product offering and
you approve this customer order, decomposition begins with the creation of the domain
orders as per the defined specification relationships and decomposition rules. Because
this customer order doesn't have the values for these characteristics for Routing and WAN
Optimization, the decomposition rule doesn't create the service orders.


However, as a part of the order fulfillment process, the information for Routing and WAN
Optimization must be available. When your fulfillment agent provides the values for these
characteristics, the decomposition rule creates the necessary service orders and the order
decomposition completes.

**Staggered decomposition**


Learn how you can stagger the decomposition for your customer orders. You can
decompose your customer orders in multiple iterations by using the available information at
the domain level, rather than decomposing an entire customer order at one time after it is
approved for fulfillment.


Staggered decomposition helps you fulfill your customer orders even when service and
resource orders were created from different factors, such as a customer's need, availability
of the services at a customer's location, and so on. Staggered decomposition creates the
domain orders (product, service, and resource orders) at a later stage during the order
fulfillment process. The decomposition process is based on the latest information.


However, the one-time order decomposition process (prior to the staggered decomposition)
works well when the products and services have the necessary information and order
approval to create the domain orders for the order fulfillment.


The following diagram shows how the staggered decomposition process works. You can start
the decomposition process with the information that you already have for your order and
order line items. The decomposition process skips the domain orders (product or service or
resource orders) that you don't have the required information for at this time. When you add
this information later, the decomposition process triggers and completes the processing for
the remaining domain orders.


**Staggered decomposition processing**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-325-0.png)


**Contrast to earlier decomposition processing**


Before staggered decomposition was available, order decomposition processing started
immediately after a customer order was approved for fulfillment. Order decomposition was
based on the specification relationships and decomposition rules that were defined in the
product catalog.


If the decomposition rule depended on any characteristic value that was not available at
the time of order decomposition, the order processing skipped the decomposition of orders.
However, in staggered decomposition, with the initial decomposition, the decomposition
automatically triggers again for the skipped orders when the dependent characteristic
value is available. The characteristic value can be set by your order fulfillment users or by the
attribute propagation rules.

**How staggered decomposition works**


To support order decomposition in a staggered manner, you can use this method to retrigger
the decomposition process for the skipped domain orders when the characteristic values are
assigned in the corresponding decomposition rules.


When you approve an order, the order decomposition process starts. The decomposition
process creates domain orders by using the information that is available from the order, order
line items, and catalog definition. It also evaluates the decomposition rules to create the
target domain orders. If the decomposition feature fails to evaluate the decomposition rules
due to the unavailability of characteristic values, the decomposition is stopped for those
domain orders.


When the characteristic values are available either from a user’s action or from an attribute

propagation rule, the decomposition process is retriggered. The process then creates the
required domain orders and completes the order decomposition. If you again update
the characteristic value after the order decomposition is complete, it does not trigger the
decomposition for the domain order.


To understand staggered decomposition with the help of an example, see Customer order
decomposition.

**Customer order decomposition**


Learn about the customer order decomposition, including quantity-based decomposition,
handling change orders with updated quantity characteristics, and support for quantity
revisions in in-flight orders.

**Quantity-based decomposition**


Quantity based decomposition enables you to decompose your order into separate domain
orders as per the order quantity to manage the fulfillment process and independently. This
method also supports:


**•** Revision of order line item quantity for in-flight orders to fulfill customer’s request to modify

(increase or decrease) the quantity of the order.


**•** Support for change of product order to fulfill a customer's request to update the

quantity characteristics. It leads to either the creation of new product inventories or the
cancellation of existing product inventories.


**Support for a change order with an update for quantity characteristics**


When you receive a customer request to revise an order through changing a product
characteristic or characteristic value, you can upgrade or downgrade an existing product
inventory. As a part of the fulfillment process, you either create new product inventories or
cancel existing product inventories.


**•** If a change in a quantity characteristic option leads to additional new product inventories,

the decomposition process creates the domain orders for the target specification and
inventories for the fulfillment process.


**•** If a change in a quantity characteristic option leads to the cancellation of some existing

inventories, the decomposition process creates the domain orders needed to manage
both the cancellation and changes to the inventories.


**◦** The fulfillment process notifies the order fulfillment manager to identify the inventories

require cancellation or update.


**◦** The decomposition process sets the **Needs Attention** field to **True** for the domain orders.


**◦** The order fulfillment manager then views these orders in the Needs Attention widget.

The order fulfillment manager can wait to open the domain orders, select the product
inventories for cancellation, or update it to resume the order decomposition and
fulfillment process.


**Support for quantity revision for in-flight orders**


When the order fulfillment process is in progress, and you receive a request to revise to
increase or decrease an order line item quantity, it is captured as a quantity change. To
incorporate the revision, the decomposition process then either creates additional domain
orders (referred to internally as a `+ve change` ) or cancels the existing domain orders (referred
to internally as a `+ve change` ) for the order fulfillment.


**•** If the order revision request is for an increase to the order line item quantity, the

decomposition process creates new domain orders to match the updated order line item
quantity.


**•** If the order revision request is for a reduction in the order line item quantity, the

decomposition process initiates the cancellation process for some of the domain orders to
match the reduced order line item quantity.

**Order orchestration**


Order orchestration begins after a customer or service order is decomposed into smaller,
individual product and service orders. The primary goal of order orchestration is to promote
accurate, timely, and efficient fulfillment of orders.


Order orchestration is a strategic framework and set of coordinated processes that define
how an organization fulfills customer orders or service requests. The Order Management
application automates the complex, multi-step fulfillment of customer and service orders
by breaking them into smaller product, service, and resource tasks corresponding to the
domain order. These tasks are executed across various systems, both internal and external to
ServiceNow.


Order orchestration involves the coordination and optimization of multiple functions and
resources, including inventory management, order processing, shipping, and delivery.


**Supporting systems**


Effective orchestration relies on integrated technologies such as the following:


**•** Order management systems: Centralized platforms for handling order data and workflows.


**•** Warehouse management systems: Tools for tracking inventory, storage, and fulfillment

operations.


**•** Transportation management systems: Solutions for planning, executing, and optimizing the

movement of goods.


**Steps in an orchestration plan**


An order orchestration plan typically includes the following steps:


**•** Order capture and validation: Receiving and verifying customer orders.


**•** Inventory check and allocation: Verifying stock availability and assigning inventory.


**•** Supplier and carrier coordination: Engaging third-party vendors and logistics partners.


**•** Fulfillment and delivery tracking: Monitoring shipment progress and delivery performance.


**Using the order orchestration UI**


By using the order orchestration user interface (UI), you can make sure that you do all the
tasks that are required to fulfill your customer orders. You can also view the complete order
hierarchy, the status of the associated decomposed orders, the order line items, and the
order tasks.


As an order fulfillment manager or agent, the order orchestration UI is your command center
for managing the end-to-end fulfillment process. Use the order orchestration UI to track all
domain orders and order tasks for an order, order line item, or domain order. You can also
use the UI to review and resolve any issues for related order tasks and domain orders.


**Accessing the UI**


You can access the order orchestration UI in the following two ways:


**•** From the Order Details page: Go to the Order breakdowns section and select **View order**

**orchestration** .


**•** From individual order lines: Open an order line item, then navigate to the **Order**

**Orchestration** tab.

Use the order orchestration UI to see:


**•** A pictorial representation that shows the hierarchy of all order line items, domain orders,

and order tasks for an order, order line item, or a domain order.


**•** The dependencies between the domain orders and order tasks.


**•** The current state of the associated order line items, domain orders, and order tasks within

the hierarchy.


The following image shows the order orchestration UI:


**Order orchestration UI**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-329-0.png)


By using the order orchestration UI, you can perform the following actions:


**•** View a hierarchical visual representation of all order line items, domain orders, and order

tasks for the selected order.


**•** Open a node in the hierarchy and view the additional details.


**•** Determine the current state of the associated order line items, domain orders, and order


tasks.


**•** Identify any order delays or fallouts in the order fulfillment process, and resolve them on

time.


**Fulfilling multi-site orders**


The order orchestration UI is especially helpful when you fulfill customer orders that involve
multiple products that are fulfilled at multiple locations. For example, a customer orders the
SD-WAN Service Package for their San Jose, San Diego, Denver, and Dallas locations. That
means that there’s a minimum of three order line items for each of the four locations:


**•** One line item for the SD-WAN Service Package


**•** One line item for the SD-WAN Controller product


**•** One line item for the SD-WAN Edge product

Other company names, product names, and logos may be trademarks of the respective companies with which they are associated.


If the same customer also orders an optional SD-WAN Security product for each location,
there would be an extra four order line items. That is, there's one order line item for each of
the four locations (San Jose, San Diego, Denver, and Dallas).


To initiate the fulfillment process for a multi-site order, the Order Management application
decomposes the order into multiple domain orders for fulfillment. The domain orders are
the product, service, and resource orders that are generated during decomposition. Each
decomposed order has a corresponding fulfillment flow with several order tasks. To fulfill an
order by the delivery dates that you promise to your customer, you must complete all the
related domain orders and resolve all the related order tasks on time.

Managing order fallout


**Managing inflight order changes and cancellation requests**


Manage how your organization receives changes for customer orders, service orders or
individual line items that are still being orchestrated and fulfilled. By using inflight change
order management, you can designate when you permit such changes. You can also assess
the impact of the requested changes for an order or order line item, and automatically
generate a plan to compensate for them when you approve the revision or cancellation
request.


**Overview of inflight order changes**


An inflight order is an order that is in the process of being orchestrated and fulfilled but
has some work pending. Inflight changes and cancellations can occur in large enterprise
orders. An inflight order change refers to a change that is issued for an order line item that is
currently undergoing fulfillment and pending completion.


Enterprise order management is complex. It can take weeks or months to fulfill a multi-site
order. Enterprise orders can involve the large-scale purchases of products and services,
often for multiple locations around the world. Inflight orders can go through revisions that
incorporate changes that are submitted by customers or identified by internal personnel
during the order fulfillment process.


To revise an inflight order or order line items that have already been decomposed to
suborders, service provider employees have to assess the impact of the requested changes.
If there is no data-driven process and framework, users try to manage the changes with
manual tasks that can lead to delays in the order delivery process and result in poor
customer and employee experiences.


By using inflight change order management, you can determine how to manage changes
for customer orders that are still being fulfilled. By managing inflight changes, your
organization can reduce operational costs and deliver a better customer experience.


You can use an inflight change to modify a customer order that is still in fulfillment. You define
a point of no return (PONR) after which the order can't accept any change. After an inflight
change is received and approved, order management dynamically assesses the impact
of the requested change and automatically generates a plan to orchestrate the order
correctly. With Order Management, your organization can manage the inflight changes
more easily, reduce operational costs, and deliver a better customer experience.

**Types of Inflight order changes**


Order change requests typically originate from your customers for purchased products and
services or from internal personnel, such as order fulfillment agents, when they are managing
their fulfillment. When you submit an inflight order revision, you assign a change type to track
the types of order changes that are submitted by users. The ServiceNow AI Platform supports
Characteristic, Contact, Quantity, related items, and Price change types.


Order revision or cancellation is a two-step process. First, an operator makes the required
updates or requests that an order or order line item is to be canceled. Next, when the order is
created, an order fulfillment or service order manager approves the revision or cancellation
request.


Customer-initiated requests


Based on the types of customer requests, you update an inflight order to do the actions that
are listed in the following table.


**Customer-driven order changes**









|Type of change|Example|
|---|---|
|Incorporate changes that are related to<br>contact details. These changes can include<br>an update, deletion, or addition of contact<br>information for an order line item for a<br>product or service in a location.|A customer supplies a new email address or<br>the name and telephone number of a new<br>corporate contact.|
|Incorporate changes that are related to<br>pricing details.|A customer requests a reduction to a non-<br>recurring charge or a monthly recurring<br>charge on an order line item.|
|Add a product or service to an order.|A customer wants to add a new item to an<br>existing order.|
|Increase or decrease the quantity of order<br>line items in a product or service order.|A customer wants a higher or lower the<br>quantity of an existing order.|
|Add, change, or cancel a product or<br>service, or product or service options, in a<br>related domain product or service order.|A customer wants to update the<br>characteristic value of a product or service<br>that the customer ordered at an earlier<br>date. For example, the customer wants to<br>change the speed of an internet service<br>from 100 Mbps to 500 Mbps.|
|Incorporate changes that are applicable<br>to the related items of a product or service<br>order.|A customer wants to add or change an item<br>to an order that has horizontal relationships.<br>To learn more, seeHorizontal relationships<br>between products.|


Fulfillment user-initiated requests





To expedite the completion of the order fulfillment process, the order fulfillment or service
order agents and managers often request changes to product, service, or resource orders.
Based on the types of internal requests, you update an inflight order to do the actions listed
in the following table.

**Inflight Order Change processing**





When a user or order fulfillment manager attempts to make any of these changes, the Inflight
Change Order function proceeds through a structured processing sequence as shown in the
following diagram.


**Inflight order change high-level approach**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-332-0.png)

Other company names, product names, and logos may be trademarks of the respective companies with which they are associated.


The sequence for inflight change order processing is as follows:


**1.** The Inflight Change Order function determines where in the processing cycle the order is.

You can only create inflight order revision and cancellation requests for orders that are in
an In Progress state.


**2.** The ServiceNow AI Platform then determines whether the proposed revision can safely be

made to the in-progress order. It evaluates the Point of No Return (PONR) status for the
order and its current stage in the fulfillment process.


The PONR flag represents the no or go point at which you can't change an order:


**◦** You can make an inflight change only for order line items with an In Progress state.


**◦** You can't make inflight changes for an order that has already been decomposed into its

domain product, service, or resource orders, and product installation has already started.


**Note:** You can find the **PONR** option when you are viewing or maintaining customer
or service orders in the Customer Order and Order Line Item forms.


**3.** After an operator makes the requested changes, this functionality evaluates the type of

change and its magnitude and impact on the fulfillment process as follows:


**◦** Simple informational changes, such as contact data, may or may not impact the

fulfillment as configured in the orchestration plan.


**◦** If the customer requests to delete an ordered product or service, the impact of the

changes, if permitted, would be greater, depending on its progress in the order fulfillment

process.


**4.** The ServiceNow AI Platform then creates a compensation plan to trigger the tasks to fulfill

the revised scope of the order as follows:


**◦** The compensation plan creates the automated revisions that are required to the

fulfillment workflow to adjust to the requested order changes.


**◦** If the customer adds products or services to the order, the compensation plan generates

additional order tasks to handle the fulfillment of the newly ordered items.


**◦** For a product substitution, the compensation plan generates an undo task to release

the old product or service and a redo task for assignment of the new product or service.
After the old product has been released, it can be sold to another customer.


**◦** For a product characteristic change, the compensation plan undoes some tasks to

revert the work that is not applicable for a new characteristic value or option. The
compensation plan can also include a few tasks that are required for some of the
completed tasks. There could also be a few existing tasks that are unaffected by the
revisions that were submitted as part of the order revision.


**5.** A manager can then track the revised workflow. By using the Inflight Order Change

functions, your organization can gain the following benefits:


**◦** Reduced manual intervention that is required to manage an inflight change order.


**◦** Reduced time to create a revised plan for a change, which results in faster order

fulfillment cycles.


**Inflight order change example**


The following diagram shows the process where PONR occurs for order changes that were
made for an SD-WAN Service Package and its related products.

**SD-WAN Service Package inflight change orders**

For the top-level SD-WAN Service package, the PONR only occurs before the testing and turn
up stage. A customer or internal fulfillment personnel can't change the ordered item after
that point.


For subordinate products, such as the SD-WAN Edge device, the order can be changed
before the Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) configuration completes. If CPE delivery is
initiated but doesn't complete, and a product substitution is requested, the Inflight Change
Order function can do the following actions:


**•** Generate an undo task for the original item.


**•** Generate a redo task for the replacement item.


**•** Create undo and redo tasks for the Prepare and build CPE configuration and Allocate and

Assign CPE tasks that are completed before revision. The Inflight Change Order function
can generate these undo and redo tasks because the CPE delivery task is not complete for
the replacement item.


After the CPE configuration is complete, no further changes are allowed in the order for that
device. This scenario also applies to the SD-WAN Controller and SD-WAN Security selections.


**Key inflight order change and cancellation request fields**


Learn how the ServiceNow AI Platform uses key fields in the Customer Order and Order
Line Item forms to track your order changes and cancellation requests. You can see how
these fields operate and what information they show you when you revise or request a
cancellation of an order, or order line items.


**Point of no return (PONR)**


The **PONR** (Point of No Return) option on the Customer Order and Order Line item forms
indicates the PONR state for the order or order line item. While fulfillment is in process, you
can use the PONR option to determine if you can revise or request cancellation of an order
or an order line item. You can only do these actions for orders and order line items that are in
an In Progress state and have yet to reach the PONR stage.


**Note:** The **Revise Order** and **Cancel Order** buttons are enabled only for order or order
line items in this state.


Learn what happens with the **PONR** option:


**•** If you select the PONR option, it indicates that you can't revise or request a cancellation for

the order or order line item while fulfillment is in progress. If any of the line items on an order
reaches PONR, you can't revise the other line items on the same order.


**•** If the check box is cleared, you can still revise or request a cancellation for the order or

order line item.

**Note:** The **PONR** option is a system-assigned flag that you can't manually update.


By using the SET PONR action in Workflow Studio, your administrator can manually
configure the PONR state in the fulfillment workflow. For example, in the demo data for
the SD-WAN Edge product specification workflow, the PONR action is available after
the Initiate CPE delivery task.


**Version**


A customer or service order can go through multiple revisions during its fulfillment cycle. The
**Version** field tracks the number of times that you revised or requested a cancellation of the
order or order line item during the fulfillment process. A new order without any revisions has a
version of 1 and automatically increments for each inflight revision.


**Revision Operation**


The **Revision Operation** field indicates the type of revision operation, if any, that is taking
place in the current version of the order or order line item. The types of revision are as follows:


None


No update or cancellation is taking place for the order or order line item. This
setting is the default for new orders and is applicable for orders without any
Inflight revisions.


Update


A Contact, Characteristic, Quantity, or Price inflight revision has been submitted
for the order or order line item.


Cancel


An order or order line item is canceled, or in the process of being canceled.


**Change Type**


When you submit an inflight order revision, the ServiceNow AI Platform automatically
assigns a change type for the tracking of the order changes that are submitted by users.
Characteristic, Contact, or Price types are standard in the ServiceNow AI Platform.


The change types are automatically assigned to the order or order line item when an order
fulfillment or service order agent makes the following types of changes.


**Assigned change types**






|Type of change made|Assigned change type|
|---|---|
|Changes any of the order characteristics.|Characteristic|
|Adds, changes, or deletes the order contact information.|Contact|
|Changes any price field.|Price|
|Changes made to the order line item quantity for a product<br>or service order.<br>To learn more, seeOrder quantity support in Order<br>Management.|Quantity|

**State when initiating and approving inflight order revisions**


When you initiate, and then approve, inflight order revisions, the affected order, order line
items, domain orders, and order tasks go through different states.


When initiating an inflight order revision

Other company names, product names, and logos may be trademarks of the respective companies with which they are associated.


To initiate an inflight order change, click **Revise Order** in the Customer Order form or in the
Order Line Item form. The following actions take place:


**1.** The customer or service order moves from an In Progress to a Revision in Progress state.


**2.** The associated order line items move from an In Progress state to a Revision in Progress

state.


**3.** The associated product, service, and resource domain orders move from their current

states to an On Hold state.


**4.** The associated order tasks move to an On Hold state.


When approving an inflight order revision


To approve an inflight revision, an order fulfillment or service order manager clicks **Approve** in
the Customer Order form. The following actions take place:


**1.** The updated order and order line item information triggers the decomposition process as

follows:


**◦** The decomposition process may create additional domain product, service, and

resource orders to incorporate the characteristic changes that were submitted as part of
an inflight order change.


**◦** It may also cancel existing domain orders that are not relevant to the requested change.

For example, if a customer upgrades their purchased internet service to a higher speed,
it would create a domain order for a modem that supports the higher speed service. It
then would cancel the existing domain order for the modem that only supported lower
speeds.


**2.** The customer or service order moves from a Revision in Progress state to an Acknowledged

state. When the order decomposition is complete, it then moves back to an In Process
state.


**3.** The associated order line items move from a Revision in Progress state to an Acknowledged

state. When the order line item decomposition is complete, they then move back to an In
Process state.


**4.** The associated product, service, and resource domain orders change from an On Hold

state to a Scheduled state. The associated subflows change the state again during
fulfillment processing.


New domain orders may also be created, based on the revisions that were submitted by
the customers. They remain in either the Draft or the In Progress states, depending on the
configuration of the fulfillment flow for the parent domain order.


**5.** The ServiceNow AI Platform refreshes the fulfillment flows for all the decomposed orders.

The ServiceNow AI Platform also reassesses all order tasks, depending on the sequencing of
the tasks in the corresponding fulfillment workflow. The associated order tasks then move to
one of the states that are listed in the following table:


**Assigned order task states**

|State|Description|
|---|---|
|Scheduled|An order task moves to this state and remains there until<br>processed, as per the fulfillment workflow.|
|In Progress|If an order task was in an In Progress state at the time you<br>initiated the inflight order revision, it remains in this state. If the|

|Closed Complete|If an order task was in a Closed Complete state at the time you<br>initiated the inflight order revision, it stays in this state. It stays in<br>this state as long as the task isn't in an inflight configuration due<br>to other changes that were submitted as part of an inflight order<br>revision.|


**6.** After the order decomposition is complete and the fulfillment flow restarts, order fulfillment

agents can go ahead and work on the associated order tasks to complete fulfillment.


**State when initiating and approving order cancellation requests**


When you initiate and approve an order cancellation request, the affected order, order line
items, domain orders, and order tasks go through different states during processing.


When initiating an order cancellation request


To initiate a cancellation request, you click **Cancel Order** in the Customer Order form, or
**Cancel Order Line Item** in the Order Line Item form. The following actions take place:


**1.** The order moves to an Assessing Cancellation state.


**2.** The associated order line items move to an Assessing Cancellation state.


**3.** The associated product, service, and resource domain orders move from their current

states to an On Hold state.


**4.** The associated order tasks move to an On Hold state.


When approving an order cancellation request


To approve an inflight revision or cancellation request, an order fulfillment or service order
manager clicks **Approve** in the Customer Order form. The following actions take place:


**1.** The decomposition process is triggered with the updated order and order line item

information.


**2.** The order moves from an Assessing Cancellation state to a Cancellation in Progress state.


**3.** The associated order line items move to a Cancellation in Progress state.


**4.** The associated domain product, service, and resource domain orders move from their

current state to an On Hold state.


**5.** The associated order tasks move to an On Hold state.

**Order fulfillment**


Learn about the order fulfillment process and tools available for monitoring and tracking
order tasks so your teams can fulfill orders efficiently, handle exceptions in a timely manner,
and drive customer satisfaction.


**Order fulfillment process**


Order fulfillment tasks are the actionable units that drive the completion of domain orders
(product, service, resource) within Order Management. The following illustration shows the
how the fulfillment tasks are created, processed, managed, and closed.


**Order fulfillment workflow**


**1.** Task creation


**◦** Order fulfillment tasks are automatically generated as part of the orchestration plan

when an order is approved and decomposed into domain orders.


**◦** Each domain order (product, service, resource) can have multiple associated tasks,

created based on product specifications, decomposition rules, and workflow logic.


**◦** Order tasks are created in parallel or in sequence, with dependencies managed via

workflow configuration.


**2.** Task assignment


**◦** Tasks are automatically assigned to fulfillment agents or teams responsible for execution

using the orchestration logic. Fulfillment managers can manually reassign tasks as
needed.


**◦** SLA definitions and jeopardy management policies are linked to tasks to monitor progress

and flag delays.


**3.** Task execution


**◦** Fulfillment agents perform the required actions for each task, such as provisioning,

configuration, shipment, or installation.


**◦** Fulfillment managers track the progress of tasks and domain orders in real time using tools

like the timeline view and order orchestration UI, which provide visibility into task status,
dependencies, and risk indicators.


**◦** Agents update task status, add notes, and resolve issues as they work through the

fulfillment steps.


**4.** Monitoring and exception handling

ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries.
Other company names, product names, and logos may be trademarks of the respective companies with which they are associated.


**◦** Agents periodically monitor the progress of all fulfillment tasks and the overall order.


**◦** If a task encounters an issue such as missing information, system error, or delay, it can be

escalated or flagged for jeopardy management.


**◦** Notifications are sent to relevant stakeholders if tasks are delayed or require attention.


**5.** Task completion and closure


**◦** After the required actions for a task are completed, agents update the task status to

Complete.


**◦** Closing all tasks associated with a domain order triggers the closure of the domain order

itself.


**6.** Order closure


**◦** When all fulfillment tasks and domain orders are closed, the overall order is marked as

complete.


**◦** Final updates are made to the sold products or product inventory, and customer records

as needed.


**Tools for tracking order fulfillment**


Provide powerful tools to fulfillment agents and managers for monitoring and managing
the entire order fulfillment life cycle. The order timeline view and the order orchestration UI
enables users to track order line items, domain orders, and order tasks for any given order, all
within a single, unified workspace.


The timeline view offers a comprehensive, Gantt-style visualization of all order line items and
associated tasks for an order. Fulfillment agents and managers can see the current status
of each task, including jeopardy indicators that highlight at-risk items, estimated durations,
and dependencies between tasks. This view allows users to quickly assess progress, identify
bottlenecks, and take proactive action to expedite fulfillment. By consolidating all relevant
information such as order lines, domain orders, and tasks into one interface, agents no longer
need to navigate multiple forms or lists, streamlining their workflow and improving operational
efficiency. To learn more, see View an order timeline.


The order orchestration UI provides a hierarchical, expandable view of how fulfillment
tasks are grouped and related by domain helping you to visualize how order line items,
domain orders, and order tasks are structured and interconnected. Fulfillment agents
and managers can drill down into specific domains or tasks, understand relationships and
dependencies, and view summary information such as duration and jeopardy status. The
order orchestration UI displays the dependencies between domain orders and order tasks,
helping you understand which tasks must be completed before others can begin. You can
also view the current state of each associated order line item, domain order, and order task
within the hierarchy, making it easy to identify progress, spot bottlenecks, and address issues
proactively. This tool is especially valuable for complex orders that span multiple domains,
as it clarifies how tasks are sequenced and coordinated. The orchestration UI complements
the timeline view by offering deeper insight into the structure and flow of fulfillment activities,
empowering users to resolve issues and optimize task execution without losing sight of the
broader order context. For more information, see Using the order orchestration UI.


**Order fulfillment types**


Order fulfillment is the process of executing customer orders by coordinating tasks across
systems and domains to ensure timely and accurate delivery. There are two key fulfillment
actions:

**•** Deliver: This involves providing the ordered items to the customer once the order is ready.


**•** Qualify: This confirms that all preceding tasks are complete, allowing processing to begin

for associated product or resource order tasks.


These fulfillment types help streamline operations and ensure that each order progresses
smoothly through its life cycle.

**•** The **State** field for the customer order is automatically set to **Completed** .


**•** The **State** field for each of the individual customer order line items is set to **Completed** .


**•** Corresponding sold products or product inventory records are created depending on the

configuration.


**What to do next**
Create MACD orders directly from the sold products.


**Creation of sold product and product inventory records**


Learn how the Order Management application creates and maintains the customer product
and service inventory. By using this application, you can maintain an accurate inventory of
your customer products and services.


**Customer product data record creation**


Sold product records are created and added to the Sold Product

[sn_install_base_sold_product] table after an order line is marked as closed complete.
Product inventory records are created and added to the Product Inventory

[sn_prd_invt_product_inventory] table after an order is fulfilled. Product inventory records
are created for products with specifications. Depending on how your admin has configured
the sn_ind_tmt_orm.enable_prod_invt_for_order_management system property, either sold
products or product inventory records are created. For more information, see Configure
customer product data management.


The Product Inventory table extends the Sold Product table.


**New order workflow**


The new order workflow is as follows:


**1.** After the fulfillment or service order manager approves the order, the product inventory

record is created. This record has placeholders for all the specifications that are generated
after decomposition. The associated models have an Installation Pending state.


**2.** During the fulfillment process, when the product, service, and resource orders are closed,

the state of the associated specification updates to Active in the product inventory record.


**3.** When you close the customer order, all the characteristics that are associated with the

specifications on the customer order update the record.


**Change order workflow**


The change order workflow is as follows:


**1.** After the fulfillment manager or service order approves the order, the state of the

changed or removed specifications are updated to Change Pending. The models that are
associated with the changed specifications are also updated to reflect the latest model
that is generated due to the change.


**2.** During the fulfillment process, when the product, service, and resource orders are closed,

the state of the associated specification updates to Active.


**3.** When you close the customer order, all the characteristics that are associated with the

specifications on the customer order update the record.


**4.** If the change order included a request to disconnect a product or service, the associated

product inventory record moves to an Inactive state after the order is complete.

You can create orders with action type as disconnect for product inventory records that
are in Active or Suspended states.


For suspend type orders, the end state is Suspended after the suspend workflow is
completed. Product inventory state changes from Active to Suspended after all tasks and
jobs have finished.


For resume type orders, the end state is Active after the resume workflow is completed.
Product inventory state changes from Suspended back to Active after all tasks and jobs
have finished.

Managing post-fulfillment order changes


**Managing order fallout**


Order fallout occurs when an order encounters an error in its normal fulfillment flow. Learn

how Fallout Management enables you to identify, investigate, and resolve order issues so
that orders can be processed to completion.


**Overview of order fallout**


Order fallout refers to the failures that occur due to errors and exceptions that may take
place during order fulfillment. Fallout is a task-type object created to support scenarios
where an order fails to proceed. These exceptions include the following:


**•** Incorrect data


**•** Connectivity problems


**•** Inadequate inventory supply


**•** Other unforeseen issues


Some issues could originate in inbound and outbound external systems that integrate with
Order Management. A single order task can have multiple types of fallout issues.


The following table provides examples of fallout errors and exceptions that can occur during
order processing.


**Fallout errors and exceptions**







|Type of failure|Description|
|---|---|
|Failures in downstream<br>fulfillment systems|Fulfillment system can't process the request due to incorrect<br>or missing data.|
|Failure to complete system<br>interaction in a timely manner|Timeouts that occur during system interactions.|
|Failure in connection|**•** Network connectivity issue.<br>**•** Unable to locate or route a request to a target system.|
|Unavailable inventory|Inventory stock isn't available in the Enterprise Resource<br>Planning (ERP system) to fulfill certain items on the order.|

**Fallout Management functions**


With Fallout Management, you can track each order fallout and automatically trigger the
actions and interventions that can resolve your order fallout in a timely manner. The following
diagram shows the order fallout management flow.


**Order Fallout Management flow**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-350-0.png)


Fallout Management enables you to identify the orders in a failed state. Fallout tasks can be
triggered and automatically routed to the appropriate team to investigate, diagnose, and
resolve the underlying issue that is stopping order fulfillment. With Fallout Management, you
can identify, route, assign, manage, and monitor the entire life cycle of an order fallout.


**Fallout Management tools**


The Fallout Management function includes the following tools:


Order fallout tracking


With this tool, you can assign a unique number to each order fallout to track
the progress of the fallout, from inception through resolution. By using an Order
Fallout dashboard, a designated order fallout manager can view the status of all
open fallout records. To learn more, see Review a fallout record.


Fallout resolution


With this tool, you can use the ServiceNow AI Platform features such as routing,
notifications, and Workflow Studio to process order fulfillment exceptions in an
automated manner. To learn more, see Creating automated fallout records.


For example, your customer orders a router, but insufficient inventory quantities are available
in your ERP system to reserve the item and fulfill the order.


**•** You create a fallout record for tracking and investigative purposes. This record places the

customer order line item on hold.


**•** An order fulfillment agent can follow up to determine what is causing the shortage. It can

be due to the unavailability of the host ERP system or because of an actual stock outage
for the ordered item. If it's due to a stock outage, someone can take remedial action to
contact the customer, reorder the item, or find a suitable replacement.


After you resolve the issue, you can restore the customer order line item back to a normal
state for completion of the order.


Without a fallout management process, your order fulfillment personnel would have to
analyze and resolve these fallout issues manually. These additional tasks would result in a
longer fulfillment process and could lead to poor customer and employee experiences.

**Creating automated fallout records**


With Fallout Management, a provider can create automated fallout records for specific
order tasks so that your orders can continue processing through to completion.


To enable creation of automated fallout records, you configure an order fulfillment workflow
in the Workflow Studio.


**•** To do so, use the **Create fallout** action when defining processing scenarios and conditions.


**•** You can define workflows for the parent records that the order tasks originate from.

Generally, order tasks originate from the customer or service orders and order line items.


[To learn more, see Flow Designer](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=flow-designer&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-application-development) .


You might encounter the following scenarios when you are attempting to fulfill customer and
service orders.


Scenarios of fallout failures with downstream systems


This fallout scenario could be a situation where failures are expected to be temporary and
resolved over time. Ideally, order processing should not be affected, and work should resume
after the network and system resources come back online. A typical scenario is as follows:


**•** The order task sends a request to an external or provisioning system.


**•** The response from the external system comes back as `Timeout` or `Unable to reach` .


You can requeue the task to be sent to the downstream system for processing, up to a
predefined number of times. If the error persists after the predefined number of times, you
should change the status of the order task to Failed, and then create an incident. You can
define a workflow that automatically creates a fallout record whenever you send or retrieve
order data to or from an external system that is not available.


Scenarios that involve data problems


If data problems originate with an order that you captured from an external order
system, you should revise the order there. You then submit the revised order to the Order
Management for Telecommunications, Media, and Technology application. If data problems
originate with the tasks that are executed earlier in the process, you can do the following
actions:


**•** Create an exception from the order task.


**•** Enable the revision of the existing order.


**•** Create an order task.


Inventory availability issues


You can define a workflow that automatically creates fallout records whenever inventory
availability issues prevent the fulfillment of order line items.


External system issues


Even when the right data structure is submitted in an external system, errors can happen due
to the business logic that is implemented in the external system.


**Create a manual fallout record**


Create a fallout record manually for an order task that has a condition or issue that prevents
it from being completed.

**Monitoring order jeopardy**


Order managers and agents can monitor jeopardy-enabled fulfillment tasks. When a task
enters jeopardy, managers can take action to ensure the fulfillment workflow isn’t delayed.


When Jeopardy Management is added to fulfillment task flows, Jeopardy Management
tracks the time to complete tasks and creates a predictive assessment of the risk level to the
fulfillment plan. If a task is taking longer than the defined time, jeopardy alerts are shared.


The following table describes where you can view the jeopardy status.

**Managing post-fulfillment order changes**


Efficiently handle a variety of post-fulfillment changes to maintain service quality and
operational accuracy after initial order fulfillment. These changes include canceling,

suspending, resuming, disconnecting, and modifying orders. Each change type has distinct
workflows, dependencies, and impacts on inventory and service states.


After an initial order is fulfilled, existing customers may want to disconnect, suspend, or
resume a product or service or change specifications or location for a product they have
purchased. For example, a customer might want to disconnect their current 4G connectivity
and upgrade it to 5G connectivity. You can manage such requests by creating orders with
action type as Change, Disconnect, Suspend, and Resume. For more information, see Action
types for customer and service orders.


When you change a product or service inventory record, the ServiceNow AI Platform creates
the order line items from the specifications that you have defined. In a change service order
inventory, the order line items are created only for your selected service inventories. If you
select inventories that are top-order parent items, the order line items are created only for
the parent items, not for the child order items.


When you are canceling a product or service order inventory, the ServiceNow AI Platform
creates the order line items as per the specifications that you've defined. To cancel a
product order inventory record, if your selected inventories are top-order parent items,
the order line items are created for both the parent items and the child order items. If your
selected inventories are child-order items, the order line items are created only for the child
items.


The process to capture post-sale modification requests is similar to order capture and
fulfillment. The high-level steps are as follows:


**1.** Create an order with the required action type.


**2.** Select product inventory items you want to modify from the catalog.


**3.** Review and submit the order for approval.


**4.** Approve the order.


The order is decomposed and order tasks are created.


**5.** Fulfill the orders by closing the order tasks, domain orders, and work orders, if any.


You can also manage post-sale change requests from the customer accounts page, not
only for products and services sold to a customer, but also to contracts and entitlements
associated with the products and services. For more information about customer life cycle
[workflows, see Customer Life Cycle Management Workflows](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=customer-life-cycle-management-workflows&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-customer-service-management) .

**Suspend and resume products and services**


You can use suspend and resume actions to temporarily suspend or inactivate your product
and service inventories. That way, you can capture a customer's suspend request and
resume the products and services later.


**About suspend and resume actions**


You can temporarily suspend or inactivate your product and service inventories. The suspend
and resume requests are managed as orders with the changes in the inventory of the
product and service orders during the order decomposition and fulfillment process. An order
suspension and resume action can occur immediately or at a future date.


With suspend and resume actions, you can do the following tasks:


**•** Ingest and fulfill the suspend product and service orders.


**•** Ingest and fulfill the resume product and service orders for suspended inventories.


**•** Support future-dated suspend and resume orders by using a scheduler.


**•** Manage the product inventory state for suspend and resume scenarios.


**How the Suspend and Resume actions work**
The process for the suspend and resume actions is as follows:


**1.** A customer order of type Suspend or Resume is received in the order management system.

After reviewing the order details, a fulfillment manager approves the customer order.


**2.** When a customer order is approved, a new Product Inventory Operations

[sn_prd_invt_product_inventory_operations] table is created as a related list in the order
line items form. In case of scheduled scenario, as part of fulfillment process the state of the
product inventory operations record marks to Scheduled state for order line items.


**3.** A pre-configured scheduler tracks the Product Inventory Operations table to check for any

future scheduled date of the customer order:


**◦** If your customer order contains order line items with a future date (a date value for the

`committedDueDate` field on the order line items form), the suspend or resume action
starts on the scheduled date.


**◦** If your customer order doesn't include any date for the suspend or resume action, it starts

immediately at the time of closure of the orders.


**4.** At the time of order closure, the following changes occur:


**◦** For a scheduled scenario, the scheduler picks up the record with a Scheduled state

from the Product Inventory Operations table on the scheduled date and marks the
record state to Completed. And the inventory state of the order line item is updated to
Suspended for the suspend action and to Active for the resume action in the product
inventory table.


**◦** For an immediate scenario, the state of the record in the Product Inventory Operations

table is updated to Completed. And the inventory state of the order line item is updated
to Suspended for the suspend action and to Active for the resume action in the product
inventory table.


**5.** The inventory state in the Product Inventory Operations table is updated to Canceled in

the following two scenarios:


**◦** During the inflight changes or due to the cancellation of any order line items.


**◦** The dates for both the suspend and resume operations are scheduled, but the date for

the resume operation is before the date of the suspend operation.

**Additional validations and scenarios**


When the order line items for the suspend or resume actions are combined with the change
or disconnect actions in a single order and the inventory state of any order line item is in a
pending state, the order approval fails. The reason is due to the approval validation for the
change or disconnect order.


**Note:** During the order approval for suspend or resume or no change actions, the
product inventory should not be in the Installation Pending state.


In the order creation process for the suspend or resume actions, the `committedDueDate` field
value on the order line item form can be a past date, present date, or a future date. If it's a
past or present date, the inventory state should be set as Active for the suspend action and
set as Suspended for the resume action.


If the `committedDueDate` field value of the customer order line items is invalid (the date field
value exceeds the calendar date) for the suspend or resume action, it's then considered as
an immediate action.


In the suspend or resume type of customer orders, the parent order has precedence over a
child order. If the parent order is scheduled for an immediate suspend or resume action, but
the child order is scheduled for any future date, the entire inventory hierarchy is considered
for the immediate action.


If the top order line item for suspend or resume action is scheduled for a future date, the
entire inventory hierarchy is then considered for the suspend or resume action. Child order
line items are considered for suspend or resume action when they’re combined with a
change or a no-change action.


For an inflight change of the suspend or resume type order, only Cancellation is supported. If
an order line item or the entire order gets canceled, the Product inventory Operations record
is marked as Canceled during the order fulfillment process. The state change doesn't occur
for the Product inventory record.


In the order creation process for the suspend or resume action, you can use the external
inventory ID in the payload instead of the system-generated ID for the inventory.


**External product inventory ID**


You can use a product inventory ID from external Configure, Price, and Quote (CPQ) systems
in the Order Management application to complete the order fulfillment flow for various
actions on the product and service orders.


**Overview of external product inventory ID**


If you're using the Order Management application, you can use the enhanced TM Forum's
Open APIs to create, change, disconnect, suspend, and resume product and service orders.
After the order capture and fulfillment process, the system-generated IDs are created
against the product inventory records to manage any future requests on the inventory for
different order action types.


**Using an external ID**


With the support of an external inventory ID, you can do the following tasks:


**•** Capture the external product inventory ID in the Order Management system through the

Product and Service Order APIs.


**•** Store the external inventory ID in a new table for new orders and associate them with the

product inventory records that were created after the order fulfillment. Also, update the ID

in the external product inventory table for any inflight revisions during the order fulfillment

process.


**•** Allow external CPQ or southbound systems to use the external inventory ID to submit,

change, disconnect, suspend, and resume orders on the product inventory in the order
management system.


**Note:** You can also map the external product inventory ID with the product inventory
[record by using the Product Inventory Open API. For more information, see Product](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=product-inventory-open-api&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-api-reference)

#### **Using Customer Contracts and Entitlements**

Learn how consumers, managers, agents, and administrators use the Customer Contracts
and Entitlements application to generate service contracts and contract lines to work on the
services.


Service contracts, service contract lines, and entitlements can be created in the following

ways:


**•** Via workflows: You can create service contracts, service contract lines, and entitlements

by using the contracts and entitlements workflow. For more information, see .


**Note:** When a service contract line or entitlement is created via the Sales and Order

Management workflow, the account/consumer/household details are copied from
the sold product and it inherits the state of the sold product. Further, when the state of
the contract line changes, the same state is synced back to the parent sold product.


**•** Via API integrations:


**◦** [Service Contract API](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=servicecontract-api&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-api-reference)


**◦** [Entitlement API](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=entitlement-api&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-api-reference)


**Using Contracts and Entitlements Workflows**


Learn how contracts and entitlements using workflows enable you to create and manage
service contracts, service contract lines, and entitlements.


You can manage the life cycle of customer service contracts and entitlements from offer
creation to contract generation using contracts and entitlements workflows. Using workflows
you can suspend, resume, cancel, and renew multiple entities at once. You can also perform
the following functions using workflows:


**•** Create, suspend, resume, cancel, and renew service contracts.


**•** Create, modify, suspend, resume, cancel, and renew service contract lines, and

entitlements.


**Automatic renewal of service contracts**


While creating new service contracts from quote or orders, you can select the **Auto-**
**renew contract** option on a quote or order to automatically renew the contracts. You can
configure the auto-renewal date of the contract in the Customer Life Cycle Workflows Policy
decision table. By default, you can choose to initiate the auto-renewal 90, 60, or 30 days
before the contract end date, or on the contract creation date. For more info, see Creating
contracts and entitlements using workflows.

**Automatic renewal for service contracts on quotes**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-365-0.png)


In the Renewal adjustment basis field, you can select **List price** or **Contracted price** . Selecting
List price renews the contract at the market price of the contract at the time of the renewal
date.


**Renewal adjustment basis**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-365-1.png)


Selecting Contracted price gives you the option to renew the contract at Markdown % or
Markup % of the current contract price. For example, if you select **Markup %** field and you
enter 10 in **Renewal adjustment value**, the service contract will be renewed at 10% above
the current contract price.

**Updating contract end date**


During quote processing, the system alerts you when the contract end date is exceeding
the product offering end date. When you submit quotes for approval, a dialog box appears
alerting you. You can select the option **update contract end dates to match offering end**
**dates** to match the contract end date to the product offering end date.


**Matching the contract and product offering end dates**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/therealatreides/sn_docs/refs/heads/main/SOM/images/zurich-som.pdf-367-0.png)


If you do not select this option and approve the quote, the contract end date remains the

same.


**Co-terminate quote lines**


You can assign the same start and end dates to multiple quote lines while creating or
renewing a quote. On the **Line items** tab on the quote details page, select multiple quote
lines and then select **Co-terminate** . All the selected quote lines have the same start and end
date.

**About this task**
When an entitlement moves to the Active state, usage records are created. You can update
the usage records on the basis of units or quantities used as and when the customer uses the
services. For example, if a characteristic includes 50 visits to the customer, then the Total units
field displays 50 and the Used units field is updated after each visit. Managers can create
and update usage records for an entitlement but agents can only update the Used units
field.

**Node map elements**


The hierarchical node map visually represents the relationships of sales entities. Sales process
managers and contract admins can dynamically manage this map by linking or delinking
records, converting soft links to hard links for active monitoring. The following table describes
the function of node map elements.


**Node map elements**












|Element|Function|
|---|---|
|Filter<br>icon|Filter link by types to view associated nodes. You can filter to view all nodes or<br>hard-linked nodes.|
|Link<br>records|Link more sales records to the selected node. To add more records, select**Link**<br>**records**, then select a**Business entity**on the Link records pop-up window. Select<br>specific records that you want to link and select**Link selected**.|
|Delink|Delete child record and its hierarchy. To delink a record, select a link connecting a<br>parent node and its child nodes you no longer want to monitor, and select**Delink**.|
|Hard<br>link|Enables you to convert soft links to hard links and vice versa. To convert a link,<br>select it and select the**Hard link**toggle switch.|



By default, only three levels are displayed on the node map when you open a sales process
record in the CSM Configurable Workspace. Admins can increase or decrease the number
of levels displayed. For more information, see Customize hierarchical node map levels for
Lead-to-Cash Process Management.


Only 250 nodes can be displayed on the node map at a time. If you have more than 250
nodes, collapse some nodes and then expand and view the other nodes.


**Details pane**


A details section consolidates all relevant operational elements—tasks, emails, checklists, and
attachments—into a single pane.


**Note:**


Related lists configured in the Sales cockpit view in Next Experience UI govern the tabs
that are displayed for a sales entity on the sales dashboard.

**Difference between hard and soft-linked nodes**


Links can be toggled between hard and soft types based on whether they need to be
actively monitored.


Hard-linked nodes


A hard link is an active monitoring connection established by the sales process
manager. When a record is hard linked, it’s actively tracked, and its emails and
tasks are consolidated and visible in the sales process record. Hard links are
represented by solid lines in the node map.


Soft-linked nodes


A soft link is a passive connection based on database relationships. Records that
are soft linked aren’t actively monitored by the sales process manager, and their
emails and tasks aren’t consolidated in the sales process record. Soft links are
represented by dotted lines in the node map.


**Conditions for linking and delinking records**


Linking records: You can link records to all hard-linked nodes, including those records that are
converted from soft links to hard links.


Delinking records: You can delink only hard-linked records and they must meet either of the
following conditions:

### **Extending Order Management with ServiceNow** **applications and integrations**


You can use various ServiceNow store applications and integrations to further extend the
capabilities of Order Management.


**Applications and integrations for extending Order Management**






|Application or integration|Description|
|---|---|
|Service Bridge Order Management for<br>Providers|Enable service providers and their customers<br>to use Order Management to place and<br>fulfill complex orders, including certain types<br>of MACD orders, over Service Exchange.|

|Order Management integration with Service<br>Portfolio Management|Provide project oversight of complex, long-<br>running orders and order tasks in Order<br>Management, and manage them in Service<br>Portfolio Management.|


#### **Order Management for providers with Service Bridge**

The Service Bridge Order Management for Providers application enables service providers to
use Order Management to create product offerings and service specifications that Service
Exchange consumers can order from service catalogs in their ServiceNow instances. Order
agents and fulfillers can then complete the orders and requests on the provider instance.


**Overview of Order Management for providers with Service Bridge**


The Service Bridge Order Management for Providers application supports the sales order and
fulfillment process over Service Exchange. Published product offers and service specifications
generate remote record producers (RRPs). These remote record producers create the
remote catalog items that your consumers can order from the Service Portal on their
instance.


The workflow for generating these remote record producers involves these basic steps:


**•** Product catalog admin or manager creates the product offerings and service

specifications on a provider instance, specifying the distribution channel as Service Bridge
and indicating that product offers are sellable items. When the offerings and service
specifications are published, remote record producers (RRPs) are generated automatically
to create the remote catalog items.


**•** Service Bridge admin associates consumer criteria to the remote record producers.


**•** Service Bridge admin reviews and activates the remote record producers on the provider

instance. These remote record producers publish the remote catalog items to the service
catalog on a consumer instance.

ServiceNow, the ServiceNow logo, Now, and other ServiceNow marks are trademarks and/or registered trademarks of ServiceNow, Inc., in the United States and/or other countries.
Other company names, product names, and logos may be trademarks of the respective companies with which they are associated.


**•** Consumers request services using the remote catalog items on the service portal in their

consumer instance. The requests automatically create a provider task for fulfilling the
requests on the provider instance.


**•** On the provider instance, the order and order lines are created for order managers to

approve and agents to fulfill.


**•** On the consumer instance, consumers receive updates on the order state and worknote

comments from order agents.


**Features**


**•** Support simple and bundled product offerings with composite specifications.


**•** Support service specifications.


**•** Support quantity orders for order line items and selection of optional products and services.


**•** Synchronize product and service inventory records, which can be viewed by consumers in

their instance.


**•** Allow consumers to:


**◦** Suspend, resume, and disconnect orders


**◦** Cancel an order from the consumer instance if the order hasn't reached the point of no

return (PONR).


**Benefits**


**•** Automates the generation of remote record producers that publish offerings and service

specifications to a remote catalog.


**•** Enables faster order fulfillment on the provider instance and improves order accuracy.


**•** Facilitates communication by updating comments between the provider and customer

instance as well as sharing frequent order status updates.


**Order state mapping**


During order processing, note that order status states correspond to certain provider task
states.


**Order and provider task states**

|Order state|Provider task state|
|---|---|
|Draft|Received|
|Submitted|Received|
|Enrichment in progress|Received|
|Enrichment on hold|Received|
|New|Received|

**Next step**


As a Service Bridge admin, review the setup tasks in Configuring Service Bridge Order
Management for Providers.


**Configuring Service Bridge Order Management for Providers**


Configure the Service Bridge Order Management for Providers application, which enables
providers to use Order Management to create and fulfill product orders over Service
Exchange. Providers publish the product offerings and service specifications as remote
catalog items so that consumers can order from the Service Catalog on their own instance.


**Configuration overview**


Follow these tasks to set up the Service Bridge Order Management for Providers application,
which uses Order Management to create product offerings and service specification and
publish them ServiceNow in your provider instance as remote record producers. Service
Bridge admins can then activate these remote record producers to make the products and
services available from the Service Catalog on consumer instances.

**Configuring automatic creation of work orders**


You can enable automatic creation of work orders from Order Management for
Telecommunications, Media, and Technology to Field Service Management. Work orders
are created for domain orders and order tasks. To configure the automatic creation of work
orders, configure the decision tables in the decision builder.


Customer orders have multiple order line items that have multiple domain orders, such as
product orders, service orders, resource orders, and order tasks. For automatic creation of
work orders for a domain order, the conditions are specified in the Work Order Policy for
Domain Order decision table. For the automatic creation of work orders for order tasks, the
conditions are defined in the Work Order Policy for Order Task decision table.


After an order is approved by the manager, a work order is automatically created if the
conditions that are defined in the decision builder are met. If required, the manager can also
select **Create Work Order** to create a work order manually. The work order template in the
decision table pre-populates the fields of the automatically created work order.

**Synchronization of information between Order Management and Field**
**Service Management - Workflow scenario**


The integration between Order Management and Field Service Management provides
support for the end-to-end order fulfillment process. The following scenario shows the
seamless synchronization of data, customer information, status, and other updates between
Order Management and Field Service Management.


**Scenario**


After the order fulfillment manager approves the order in Order Management, work orders
are automatically created in Field Service Management for conditions that are specified in
the decision tree. As the field service agents work on those work orders, the order fulfillment
agent can see the updates in the Work Notes section of that Domain Order. An agent
cannot close a domain order unless all the work orders associated with it are closed. This

workflow shows synchronization of information between Order Management and Field
Service Management.


**1.** An order fulfillment agent creates a new customer order in the Order Management

workspace.


**2.** The agent then selects the location for which the order needs to be placed. For multiple

locations, multiple order line items are created.


**3.** The agent then reviews and places the order.

**4.** The order fulfillment manager approves the order. The order line items have domain orders

as part of the order fulfillment flow. According to the configurations in the decision table,
work orders are automatically created in Field Service Management.


**5.** The agent can view the work orders created for the domain orders in the **Details** tab. In the

Activity section, the agent tracks all the updates for the work orders in the work notes.


**◦** When the status of a work order changes in Field Service Management, the details are

displayed in the work notes of the Order Management workspace.


**◦** If a work order is canceled, the work order status is displayed in the Order Management

work notes section.


**◦** In case of inflight changes, the work order is automatically updated. The current status

and the updated information are displayed in the work notes section.


**6.** The agent can edit an order line item if required. If the agent selects the **PONR** (Point of No

Return) option, no changes can be made to the order line item in the workflow anymore.


**7.** After all the work orders are closed, the order fulfillment manager can review the all the

work orders and close the domain order.


**Note:** The agent cannot close a domain order unless all the work orders associated
with that domain order are closed.

#### **Order Management integration with Strategic Portfolio** **Management**

The Order Management application provides an integration with the ServiceNow [® ] Strategic
Portfolio Management (SPM) application enables project oversight of complex order
fulfillment tasks. Use this integration to handle order line items and planned order tasks as
projects in SPM.


**Features**


**•** Automates the creation of SPM projects based on project oversight rules, enabling project

managers to track order fulfillment activities within a project in SPM.


**•** Synchronizes order fulfillment tasks in Order Management to an associated project in

SPM, providing project managers with real-time task activity updates via state change
information, notes, and comments.


**•** Enable fulfillment agents, managers, and project managers to view related lists that show

the relationship between an order line item and project, domain order and project task,
and order task and project task.


**•** Supports tracking and synchronization of one or more order tasks.


**•** Supports staggered/in-flight orders for new tasks created as part of staggered

decomposition or in-flight changes. Uses predefined planned order tasks that enable
synchronization between order fulfillment and project tasks.


**•** Closes project tasks automatically when child tasks and associated order tasks or domain

orders are completed or canceled.

**Benefits**


**•** Gives project managers end-to-end project oversight of complicated orders, such as long
running orders that require delivery to a specific customer account with multiple locations.


**•** Manages risks by identifying issues that affect project dependencies and timely order

fulfillment.


**•** Eliminates manual tracking of order status between SPM and Order Management

applications. Reduces inefficient communication between project managers, fulfillment
agents and managers, and other project stakeholders.


**How the SPM integration works**


The Order Management integration with Strategic Portfolio Management uses the Project
Portfolio Management (PPM) standard application in SPM to track fulfillment tasks as projects
in your organization. This integration also works with the Customer Project Management
application if you want to track customer order fulfillment tasks as customer projects
automatically.


Configuration


Admins set up the SPM integration by configuring these items:


**•** Project templates: Create the PPM project templates that are used to

generate the SPM projects automatically for orders requiring project oversight.
Project templates also define the planned tasks for order delivery.


**•** Order Management project oversight conditions and rules: Set the conditions

and decision rules that determine the orders that qualify for project oversight
and the project templates used to create those projects. You use different
Project Management Oversight decision tables to specify the conditions
and rules for order lines, domain orders, and order tasks and the appropriate
project template to be used.


**•** Field mapping in CSM table maps: Associate Order Management fields to SPM

project fields by configuring the field mapping in the CSM table maps.


**•** Property for automatic closure of project tasks: Control the automatic closure

of project tasks when associated child tasks are completed by using the
_`sn_ind_tmt_orm.project.task.auto.closure`_ system property.


SPM integration flow


After an order line is created and approved, Order Management performs the
following processing steps.


**•** Project oversight determination: Qualifies the order line for project oversight.


**◦** Checks that the order line is valid and that the PPM Standard application is

installed.


**◦** Reviews the project oversight conditions and decision rules for order lines.


**◦** If the order line matches the conditions, automatically creates the project

and project tasks using the specified project template.


**Note:** If multiple order lines are eligible for oversight, the system creates
multiple projects.


**•** One-time synchronization: Synchronizes the order line with the project,

establishing the relationship between the order line and the project.

Other company names, product names, and logos may be trademarks of the respective companies with which they are associated.


**•** Project task oversight determination: After Order Management decomposes

the order line item into domain orders and order tasks, it does the following:


**◦** Checks the project oversight conditions for domain orders. If a domain order

meets the project oversight conditions, creates the associated project and
planned tasks using the project template task specified.


**◦** Checks the project oversight conditions for order tasks. If order tasks meet

the project oversight conditions, creates the associated project and
planned tasks using the project template task specified.


**◦** Links domain orders and order tasks back to the parent project,

synchronizing attributes from the domain orders and order tasks to the
project tasks.


**•** Order task state changes: As order task states change in Order Management,

synchronizes the state and status with corresponding project tasks in SPM so
that project managers and other project stakeholders can view the changes
in real time.


**•** Updates to project notes and comments: Automatically updates project notes

and project task notes when fulfillment managers or agents post work notes
and comments in order line items, domain orders, and order tasks.


**•** Project task closure: Automatically closes project tasks for order tasks, including

child tasks, that have been completed in Order Management.


**Plugins for the SPM integration**


The SPM integration is included with the Order Management application. The integration
requires the following plugins, which are activated by users with the admin role:


**•** PPM Standard plugin (com.snc.financial_planning_pmo): Activates the Project Portfolio

Management Standard application, which installs Financial Management and the
Project Portfolio Suite. The suite includes various applications for handling projects in
your organization, such as Program Management, Project Management, and Demand
[Management. For more information on the Project Portfolio Suite, see Project Portfolio Suite](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=c_ProjectPortfolioSuiteWithFinancials&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-it-business-management)
[with Financials](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=c_ProjectPortfolioSuiteWithFinancials&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-it-business-management) .


**•** Customer Project Management plugin (com.snc.csm_ppm): Activates the Customer

Project Management integration with the PPM Standard application. This integration
enables customer project managers to create and manage complex projects with
multiple tasks. This integration also provides end users with visibility into those projects.
[For details on Customer Project Management, see Integrating with Customer Project](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=csm-ppm-integration&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-customer-service-management)

**Creating project templates and project template tasks**


You create the project templates and project template tasks that Order Management uses
to instantiate projects for order lines and associated domain orders and order tasks.


In the SPM integration, project templates define the structure of a project for order lines and
the project planned tasks that map to the order fulfillment tasks for the order line. You specify
project templates and project template tasks in the project oversight decision rules. Order
Management uses these rules to determine which order items require oversight and the
project template or project template tasks used to create the projects.


As an admin or user with the it_project_manager role, you create project templates and the
[project template tasks in Project Portfolio Management. For more information, see Project](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=c_ProjectTemplates&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-it-business-management)
[templates](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=c_ProjectTemplates&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-it-business-management) [and Create a project template](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=t_ViewAProjectTemplateForm&version=zurich&pubname=zurich-it-business-management) . The demo data with the Order Management
application includes project templates that you can copy and change as needed.


**Note:** When you create project template tasks for domain orders and order tasks, be
sure to anticipate inflight changes that may require additional planned tasks. Define
those potential planned tasks in the template tasks so that the system can synchronize
the planned tasks with the additional order tasks resulting from inflight changes in Order
Management.


**Before creating project templates and project template tasks**


Before you create your project template and project task templates for the SPM integration,
consider the level of project oversight required for customer orders to be fulfilled. For
example, in the following SD-WAN fulfillment flow, the top order line is SD-WAN Service
Package, which defines the order line project to be created. Next, identify the domain
orders and then the order tasks that require project task oversight.

**Setting up project oversight conditions and decision rules**


As an admin, you create and maintain the conditions and decision rules that determine
whether an order item qualifies as a project that can be tracked in Strategic Portfolio
Management. You also specify the project template that Order Management uses to create
that project for the order item.


Set the conditions and decision rules for project oversight of order lines and associated
domain orders and order tasks by using Decision Builder forms for order lines, domain orders,

and order tasks. These forms have a decision table for specifying the conditions and rules to
be applied when Order Management determines eligibility for project oversight.


For example, in the Project Oversight Management for Order Line Item form, you use the
decision table to add or change condition columns. You also specify the decision rules,
including the project template, to be applied.


**Project Management Oversight for Order Line Item**

**Choosing a project template task when duplicates exist**


As an admin, when you're configuring the decision rules for domain orders and order tasks,
you may find that there are multiple project template tasks with the same **Short description** . It
may be difficult to determine the correct project template task to select.


For example, the following decision table for Project Oversight for Domain Order shows
two options with the same name for the project template task: Product Order for SD-WAN
Security. This project template task has the same **Short description** for two different project
template tasks, one for SD-WAN Package and the other for SD-WAN Customer Product
Bundle.

**About this task**
Order Management provides Customer Service Management table maps for associating
order line items, domain orders, and order tasks to projects and project tasks in SPM. The
tables that you configure depend on whether you're using the PPM Standard application to
track projects in your organization or the Customer Project Management integration to track
customer projects.


**•** If you're using PPM, configure the field mapping for these CSM table maps:


**Table maps for PPM**










|Table map Source table Target table|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Order Line Item to Project|Order Line Item<br>[sn_ind_tmt_orm_order_line_it|em]<br>Project [pm_project]|
|Domain Order to Project<br>Task|Domain Order<br>[sn_ind_tmt_orm_domain_ord|er]<br>Project Task<br>[pm_project_task]|
|Order Task to Project Task|Order Task<br>[sn_ind_tmt_orm_order_task]|Project Task<br>[pm_project_task]|




**•** If you're using Customer Project Management, configure the field mapping for these CSM

table maps:


**Table maps for Customer Project Management**












|Table map Source table Target table|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Order Line Item to Customer<br>Project|Order Line Item<br>[sn_ind_tmt_orm_order_line_it|em]<br>Customer Project<br>[customer_project]|
|Domain Order to Customer<br>Project Task|Domain Order<br>[sn_ind_tmt_orm_domain_ord|er]<br>Customer Project Task<br>[customer_project_task]|
|Order Task to Customer<br>Project Task|Order Task<br>[sn_ind_tmt_orm_order_task]|Customer Project Task<br>[customer_project_task]|



The source and target tables in each table map are pre-populated.


**Note:** If you installed demo data for Order Management, the field mapping for the
**Source Field** and **Target Field** display the values used for demo data. You can use the
existing field mapping or change it as needed.


**Procedure**


**1.** Navigate to **All** and in the filter enter `csm_table_map.list` .


**2.** Do one of the following:


**◦** If you're using PPM, select the Order Line Item to Project table map.


**◦** If you're using Customer Project Management, select the Order Line Item to Customer

Project table map.


**3.** Go to the **Basic Field Mapping** related list and define a field mapping.


**Note:** If Order Management demo data is installed, the **Source Field** and **Target**
**Field** values in the Basic Field Mapping related list display the mapping for demo
data. You can use the mapping or change it as needed.

|Option|Steps|
|---|---|
|Define a new field mapping|**a.** Select**New**.<br>**b.** In the**Source Field**, select an item from<br>the source table.<br>For example, select an item such as**Short**<br>**Description**from the Order Line Item [sn_­<br>ind_tmt_orm_order_line_item] table.<br>**c.** In the**Target Field**, select an item from<br>the Project [pm_project] table, such as<br>**Project Name**.<br>**d.** Select**Submit**.<br>In this example, the order line**Short De­**<br>**scription**is used as the**Project Name**in<br>SPM.|
|Change an existing field mapping|**a.** Select the field mapping record.<br>**b.** In the**Source Field**, select a different item<br>from the Order Line Item source table, as<br>needed.<br>**c.** In the**Target Field**, select a different item<br>from the Project target table, as needed.<br>**d.** Select**Update**.|


**4.** Do one of the following:





**◦** If you're using PPM, select the Domain Order to Project table map and repeat Step 3 to

define a new field mapping or update an existing mapping.


**◦** if you're using Customer Project Management, select the Domain Order to Customer

Project table map and repeat Step 3 to define a new field mapping or update an
existing mapping.


For example, you can select the **Short Description** field in the Domain Order source table
and map it to the **Short Description** field in the Project Task target table.


**5.** Do one of the following:


**◦** If you're using PPM, select the Order Task to Project table map if and repeat Step 3 to

define a new field mapping or update an existing mapping.


**◦** If you're using Customer Project Management, select the Order Task to Customer Project

table map and repeat Step 3 to define a new field mapping or update an existing
mapping.


For example, you can select the **Short Description** field in the Order Task source table and
map it to the **Short Description** field in the Project Task target table.


**Result**
The fields in the Order Management source tables are mapped to the fields in the SPM target
table.

**Control automatic closure of project tasks**


Manage the automatic closure of projects in the SPM integration by using the
_`sn_ind_tmt_orm.project.task.auto.closure`_ system property.


**Before you begin**
Role required: admin


**About this task**
In the SPM integration, Order Management closes project tasks automatically
when all associated order tasks are completed and there are no open child tasks
that have project task dependencies. If a project task has open child tasks, Order
Management doesn’t automatically close the project task. You can use the
_`sn_ind_tmt_orm.project.task.auto.closure`_ property to suppress or reactivate the
automatic closure of project tasks.


**Procedure**


**1.** Navigate to **All** and in the filter, enter `sys_properties.list` and press **Enter** .


**2.** Search for and open the _`sn_ind_tmt_orm.project.task.auto.closure`_ property.


**3.** In the **Value** field, set the value for the property.


**◦** To suppress automatic project task closure, enter `false` .


**◦** To reactivate automatic project task closure, enter `true` .


**4.** Select **Update** .

Automatic project task closure in the SPM integration is immediately suppressed or
reactivated based on the value that you entered. If automatic closure is suppressed, any
order task-to-project task updates occur only when order tasks are in an in-progress state.


**Tracking order tasks and associated projects**


With the SPM integration, project managers and fulfillment agents or managers can track
projects in Strategic Portfolio Management that have associated order tasks in Order
Management.


**Tracking projects for planned order tasks in SPM**


As a project manager, you can review and update projects that have been created for
tracking planned order tasks using the Project Portfolio Management application in SPM.
When fulfillment managers and agents update or complete order tasks, Order Management
automatically synchronizes project states between SPM and order line items, task and
domain order states, and project task and order task states as fulfillment managers and
agents complete order tasks.


A project manager has the it_project_manager role for tracking and updating projects.


**Project manager tasks**

#### **Customer Contracts and Entitlements reference**


Reference topics provide additional information on service contract life cycle and forms
available within the Customer Contracts and Entitlements application.


**What to explore next**


To learn more about configuring and using Customer Contracts and Entitlements, see:


**•** Configure Customer Contracts and Entitlements


**•** Using Customer Contracts and Entitlements


**Service contract life cycle**


A service contract goes through the various states in each phase of its life cycle.


In each state, a service contract is enabled to perform certain actions as mentioned in the
following table.


**Service contract life cycle, related states, and actions that it can perform**






|Life-cycle|State|Action|
|---|---|---|
|A service contract is<br>generated.|Draft|**•** The start and end dates of the service contract can<br>be modified such that the child records' dates are<br>within the date range.<br>**•** The related contract lines and entitlements can be<br>added, removed, or modified.<br>**•** The sold product/install base item covered can be<br>added or removed.|
|Service contract gets<br>activated on the date<br>of activation.|Active|**•** Modifications to the service contract can be done<br>manually, via integration and via Sales and Order<br>Management workflow.<br>**•** The start date can't be modified.<br>**•** The end date can be extended and should be<br>greater than the current date.|

**Service contract life cycle, related states, and actions that it can perform (continued)**






|Life-cycle|State|Action|
|---|---|---|
|||**•** Service contract line items can be added.<br>**•** The sold product/install base item covered can be<br>modified.|
|Service contract is<br>deactivated on the<br>date of expiration.|Expired|No action.|
|Service contract is<br>canceled.|Canceled|No action.|



The service contract line items and entitlements also perform similar actions in the respective
states.


When a parent entity moves to the Expired state, the child entities inherit the same state. For
example, when a service contract expires, the related contract lines and entitlements also
expire.


However, the state change of a child entity doesn't affect it parent entity.


The sold product or install base item referenced either in the contract line or an entitlement
must be in the same state as the entity where it's referenced.


**Suspended state**


When a sold product is suspended, the related service contract lines and entitlements, in the
Draft or Active states, move to the Suspended state as well.


A suspended service contract line or entitlement is paused for any activity, except the
following:


**•** Editing the field values.


**•** Creating records in the corresponding related lists.


On resuming the sold product, the related service contract line item or entitlement acquires
the state depending on its start and end dates. For example, a resumed entitlement that has
its start date in the past and its end date in the future, acquires the Active state.


Exceptionally, when a contract line or entitlement in the Suspended state has reached its
end date, it moves to the Expired state automatically.


**Date validations**


A service contract line associated with a service contract must be created within the service

contract's start and end dates. Any modification to the dates of service contract lines must
comply with the date range of the parent service contract.


**Service contract form**


The Customer Contracts and Entitlements application uses the Service contract form to
create service contracts.
